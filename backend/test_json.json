[[{"question": "Explain why the number 7 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13 + 13 is a composite number. [Marks 2]", "difficulty": "Medium", "answer": "The given number can be written as 7 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13 + 13. \nBy taking 13 as a common factor, the expression becomes: 13 \u00d7 (7 \u00d7 11 + 1). \nOn simplifying, we get: 13 \u00d7 (77 + 1) = 13 \u00d7 78. \nSince the number can be expressed as a product of two integers (13 and 78), it has factors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is defined as a number that has more than two factors. Therefore, 7 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13 + 13 is a composite number.", "source": [{"Chapter": "Real Numbers", "Page": "5"}]}]]
