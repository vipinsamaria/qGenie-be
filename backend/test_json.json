[[{"question": "According to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, what is true for every composite number? [Marks 1]", "options": {"a": "It can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way, regardless of the order of factors.", "b": "It can be expressed as a sum of prime numbers.", "c": "It is divisible by every prime number.", "d": "It can be expressed as a product of other composite numbers."}, "answer": "a", "reason": "The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, stated on page 3, says that every composite number can be factorised as a product of primes in a 'unique' way, except for the order in which the primes occur. Option (b) is incorrect as the theorem deals with products, not sums. Option (c) is false; for example, the composite number 9 is not divisible by the prime number 2. Option (d) is incorrect because the fundamental factorisation is into prime numbers, not other composite numbers.", "difficulty": "Easy", "source": [{"chapter": "Real Numbers", "page": "3"}]}]]
