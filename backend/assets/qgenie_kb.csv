### 5.1 INTRODUCTION

Magnetic phenomena are universal in nature. Vast, distant galaxies, the tiny invisible atoms, humans and beasts all are permeated through and through with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth's magnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from the name of an island in Greece called *magnesia* where magnetic ore deposits were found, as early as 600 BC.

In the previous chapter we have learned that moving charges or electric currents produce magnetic fields. This discovery, which was made in the early part of the nineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot and Savart, among others.

In the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism as a subject in its own right.
Some of the commonly known ideas regarding magnetism are:
1.  The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic field pointing approximately from the geographic south to the north.
2.  When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in the north-south direction. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the *north pole* and the tip which points to the geographic south is called the *south pole* of the magnet.

1.  (iii) There is a repulsive force when north poles (or south poles ) of two magnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractive force between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of the other.
2.  (iv) We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnet is broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with somewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic north and south poles known as *magnetic monopoles* do not exist.
3.  (v) It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.

We begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an external magnetic field. We describe Gauss's law of magnetism. We next describe how materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties. We describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism.

## 5.2 THE BAR MAGNET

We begin our study by examining iron filings sprinkled on a sheet of glass placed over a short bar magnet. The arrangement of iron filings is shown in Fig. 5.1.

The pattern of iron filings suggests that the magnet has two poles similar to the positive and negative charge of an electric dipole. As mentioned in the introductory section, one pole is designated the *North pole* and the other, the *South pole*. When suspended freely, these poles point approximately towards the geographic north and south poles, respectively. A similar pattern of iron filings is observed around a current carrying solenoid.

FIGURE 5.1 The arrangement of iron filings surrounding a bar magnet. The pattern mimics magnetic field lines. The pattern suggests that the bar magnet is a magnetic dipole.

### 5.2.1 The magnetic field lines

The pattern of iron filings permits us to plot the magnetic field lines\*. This is shown both for the bar-magnet and the current-carrying solenoid in Fig. 5.2. For comparison refer to the Chapter 1, Figure 1.14(d). Electric field lines of an electric dipole are also displayed in Fig. 5.2(c). The magnetic field lines are a visual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field. Their properties are:

1.  (i) The magnetic field lines of a magnet (or a solenoid) form continuous closed loops. This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines begin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escape to infinity.

\* In some textbooks the magnetic field lines are called *magnetic lines of force*. This nomenclature is avoided since it can be confusing. Unlike electrostatics the field lines in magnetism do not indicate the direction of the force on a (moving) charge.

The resemblance of magnetic field lines for a bar magnet and a solenoid suggest that a bar magnet may be thought of as a large number of circulating currents in analogy with a solenoid. Cutting a bar magnet in half is like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller solenoids with weaker magnetic properties. The field lines remain continuous, emerging from one face of the solenoid and entering into the other face. One can test this analogy by moving a small compass needle in the neighbourhood of a bar magnet and a current-carrying finite solenoid and noting that the deflections of the needle are similar in both cases.

To make this analogy more firm we may calculate the axial field of a finite solenoid depicted in Fig. 5.3 (a). We can demonstrate that at large distances this axial field resembles that of a bar magnet.

The magnitude of the field at point P due to the solenoid is
$B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{2m}{r^3}$ (5.1)

This is also the far axial magnetic field of a bar magnet which one may obtain experimentally. Thus, a bar magnet and a solenoid produce similar magnetic fields. The magnetic moment of a bar magnet is thus equal to the magnetic moment of an equivalent solenoid that produces the same magnetic field.

### 5.2.3 The dipole in a uniform magnetic field

Let's place a small compass needle of known magnetic moment **m** allowing it to oscillate in the magnetic field. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.3(b).

The torque on the needle is [see Eq. (4.23)],
$\vec{\tau} = \vec{m} \times \vec{B}$
In magnitude $\tau = mB \sin\theta$ (5.2)
Here $\tau$ is restoring torque and $\theta$ is the angle between **m** and **B**.

An expression for magnetic potential energy can be obtained on lines similar to electrostatic potential energy.
The magnetic potential energy $U_m$ is given by
$U_m = \int \tau(\theta)d\theta$
$= \int mB \sin \theta d\theta = -mB \cos \theta$
$= -\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B}$ (5.3)

We have emphasised in Chapter 2 that the zero of potential energy can be fixed at one's convenience. Taking the constant of integration to be zero means fixing the zero of potential energy at $\theta = 90^\circ$, i.e., when the needle is perpendicular to the field. Equation (5.3) shows that potential energy is minimum (= –mB) at $\theta = 0^\circ$ (most stable position) and maximum (= +mB) at $\theta = 180^\circ$ (most unstable position).

### Example 5.1
(a) What happens if a bar magnet is cut into two pieces: (i) transverse to its length, (ii) along its length?
(b) A magnetised needle in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque but no net force. An iron nail near a bar magnet, however, experiences a force of attraction in addition to a torque. Why?

### EXAMPLE 5.1

(c) Must every magnetic configuration have a north pole and a south pole? What about the field due to a toroid?
(d) Two identical looking iron bars A and B are given, one of which is definitely known to be magnetised. (We do not know which one.) How would one ascertain whether or not both are magnetised? If only one is magnetised, how does one ascertain which one? [Use nothing else but the bars A and B.]

### Solution

(a) In either case, one gets two magnets, each with a north and south pole.
(b) No force if the field is uniform. The iron nail experiences a non-uniform field due to the bar magnet. There is induced magnetic moment in the nail, therefore, it experiences both force and torque. The net force is attractive because the induced south pole (say) in the nail is closer to the north pole of magnet than induced north pole.
(c) Not necessarily. True only if the source of the field has a net non-zero magnetic moment. This is not so for a toroid or even for a straight infinite conductor.
(d) Try to bring different ends of the bars closer. A repulsive force in some situation establishes that both are magnetised. If it is always attractive, then one of them is not magnetised. In a bar magnet the intensity of the magnetic field is the strongest at the two ends (poles) and weakest at the central region. This fact may be used to determine whether A or B is the magnet. In this case, to see which one of the two bars is a magnet, pick up one, (say, A) and lower one of its ends; first on one of the ends of the other (say, B), and then on the middle of B. If you notice that in the middle of B, A experiences no force, then B is magnetised. If you do not notice any change from the end to the middle of B, then A is magnetised.

## 5.2.4 The electrostatic analog

Comparison of Eqs. (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) with the corresponding equations for electric dipole (Chapter 1), suggests that magnetic field at large distances due to a bar magnet of magnetic moment **m** can be obtained from the equation for electric field due to an electric dipole of dipole moment **p**, by making the following replacements:

**E** → **B**, **p** → **m**, $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \rightarrow \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}$

In particular, we can write down the equatorial field (**B**<sub>E</sub>) of a bar magnet at a distance *r*, for *r*>> *l*, where *l* is the size of the magnet:

$\mathbf{B}_\text{E} = -\frac{\mu_0 \mathbf{m}}{4\pi r^3}$ (5.4)

Likewise, the axial field (**B**<sub>A</sub>) of a bar magnet for *r*>> *l* is:

$\mathbf{B}_\text{A} = \frac{\mu_0 2\mathbf{m}}{4\pi r^3}$ (5.5)

(b) In which configuration is the system in (i) stable, and (ii) unstable equilibrium?
(c) Which configuration corresponds to the lowest potential energy among all the configurations shown?

FIGURE 5.4

### Solution

Potential energy of the configuration arises due to the potential energy of one dipole (say, Q) in the magnetic field due to other (P). Use the result that the field due to P is given by the expression [Eqs. (5.4) and (5.5)]:

**B**ₚ = `\frac{\mu_0 \mathbf{m}_p}{4\pi r^3}` (on the normal bisector)

**B**ₚ = `\frac{\mu_0 2\mathbf{m}_p}{4\pi r^3}` (on the axis)

where **m**ₚ is the magnetic moment of the dipole P. Equilibrium is stable when **m**_Q is parallel to **B**ₚ, and unstable when it is anti-parallel to **B**ₚ.

**KARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS** (1777 – 1855)
He was a child prodigy and was gifted in mathematics, physics, engineering, astronomy and even land surveying. The properties of numbers fascinated him, and in his work he anticipated major mathematical development of later times. Along with Wilhelm Welser, he built the first electric telegraph in 1833. His mathematical theory of curved surface laid the foundation for the later work of Riemann.

## 5.3 MAGNETISM AND GAUSS's LAW

In Chapter 1, we studied Gauss's law for electrostatics. In Fig 5.2(c), we see that for a closed surface represented by (i), the number of lines leaving the surface is equal to the number of lines entering it. This is consistent with the fact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However, in the same figure, for the closed surface (ii), there is a net outward flux, since it does include a net (positive) charge.

The situation is radically different for magnetic fields which are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the Gaussian surfaces represented by (i) or (ii) in Fig 5.2(a) or Fig. 5.2(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is balanced by the number of lines entering it. The net *magnetic flux is zero* for both the surfaces. This is true for any closed surface.

FIGURE 5.5

Consider a small vector area element ΔS of a closed surface S as in Fig. 5.5. The magnetic flux through ΔS is defined as Δφ_B = **B**·Δ**S**, where **B** is the field at ΔS. We divide S into many small area elements and calculate the individual flux through each. Then, the net flux φ_B is,

φ_B = Σ_all Δφ_B = Σ_all **B**·Δ**S** = 0 (5.6)

where 'all' stands for 'all area elements ΔS'. Compare this with the Gauss's law of electrostatics. The flux through a closed surface in that case is given by

Σ **E**·Δ**S** = q / ε₀

where `q` is the electric charge enclosed by the surface.
The difference between the Gauss's law of magnetism and that for electrostatics is a reflection of the fact that isolated magnetic poles (also called monopoles) are not known to exist. There are no sources or sinks of B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop. All magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of an arrangement of dipoles and/or current loops.
Thus, Gauss's law for magnetism is:
*The net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero.*

### Example 5.3
#### Solution
1. (a) **Wrong.** Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, as shown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of B must always be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to enter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines shown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged wire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight conductor, as described in Chapter 4.
2. (b) **Wrong.** Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross each other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of intersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure. Magnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty space. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a region across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic field lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space, nor when the loop encloses charges.
3. (c) **Right.** Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid. Nothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each loop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for clarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been shown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings contains magnetic field.
4. (d) **Wrong.** Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot be so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates Ampere's law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet eventually to form closed loops.
5. (e) **Right.** These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note carefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate out of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both the N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.
6. (f) **Wrong.** These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field. Look at the upper region. All the field lines seem to emanate out of the shaded plate. The net flux through a surface surrounding the shaded plate is not zero. This is impossible for a magnetic field. The given field lines, in fact, show the electrostatic field lines around a positively charged upper plate and a negatively charged lower plate. The difference between Fig. [5.6(e) and (f)] should be carefully grasped.
7. (g) **Wrong.** Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be precisely straight at the ends. Some fringing of lines is inevitable. Otherwise, Ampere's law is violated. This is also true for electric field lines.

### Example 5.4
1. (a) Magnetic field lines show the direction (at every point) along which a small magnetised needle aligns (at the point). Do the magnetic field lines also represent the *lines of force* on a moving charged particle at every point?
2. (b) If magnetic monopoles existed, how would the Gauss’s law of magnetism be modified?
3. (c) Does a bar magnet exert a torque on itself due to its own field? Does one element of a current-carrying wire exert a force on another element of the *same wire*?

(d) Magnetic field arises due to charges in motion. Can a system have magnetic moments even though its net charge is zero?

### Solution
(a) No. The magnetic force is always normal to **B** (remember magnetic force = $q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$). It is misleading to call *magnetic field lines as lines of force*.

(b) Gauss's law of magnetism states that the flux of **B** through any closed surface is always zero $\oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 0$.
If monopoles existed, the right hand side would be equal to the monopole (magnetic charge) $q_m$ enclosed by S. [Analogous to Gauss's law of electrostatics, $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}$ where $q$ is the (electric) charge enclosed by S.] The OCR picked up `Β.∆s =µoqm` which is `$\oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \mu_0 q_m$`. The first formula seems to have a typo in the original OCR result, it should be $\oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 0$. I will use the corrected physical notation for both.

(c) No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the field produced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque) on an element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straight wire, this force is zero.)

(d) Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet, the mean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops may not be zero. We will come across such examples in connection with paramagnetic material where atoms have net dipole moment through their net charge is zero.

EXAMPLE 5.4

## 5.4 MAGNETISATION AND MAGNETIC INTENSITY
The earth abounds with a bewildering variety of elements and compounds. In addition, we have been synthesising new alloys, compounds and even elements. One would like to classify the magnetic properties of these substances. In the present section, we define and explain certain terms which will help us to carry out this exercise.
We have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magnetic moment. In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and they can give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero. We define *magnetisation* **M** of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment per unit volume:

$\mathbf{M} = \frac{\mathbf{m}_{net}}{V}$ (5.7)

**M** is a vector with dimensions L⁻¹ A and is measured in a units of A m⁻¹.
Consider a long solenoid of *n* turns per unit length and carrying a current *I*. The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown to be given by

$\mathbf{B}_0 = \mu_0 nI$ (5.8)

If the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zero *magnetisation*, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than **B**₀. The net **B** field in the interior of the solenoid may be expressed as

$\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B}_0 + \mathbf{B}_m$ (5.9)

## Solution
(a) The field *H* is dependent of the material of the core, and is
    *H* = *nI* = 1000 × 2.0 = 2 × 10³ A/m.
(b) The magnetic field *B* is given by
    *B* = *μ_r μ_0 H*
    = 400 × 4*π* × 10⁻⁷ (N/A²) × 2 × 10³ (A/m)
    = 1.0 T
(c) Magnetisation is given by
    *M* = (*B* - *μ_0 H*) / *μ_0*
    = (*μ_r μ_0 H* - *μ_0 H*) / *μ_0* = (*μ_r* - 1)*H* = 399 × *H*
    = 8 × 10⁵ A/m
(d) The magnetising current *I_M* is the additional current that needs to be passed through the windings of the solenoid in the absence of the core which would give a *B* value as in the presence of the core. Thus *B* = *μ_r n* (*I* + *I_M*). Using *I* = 2A, *B* = 1 T, we get *I_M* = 794 A.

EXAMPLE 5.5

## 5.5 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS
The discussion in the previous section helps us to classify materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In terms of the susceptibility *χ*, a material is diamagnetic if *χ* is negative, para- if *χ* is positive and small, and ferro- if *χ* is large and positive.

A glance at Table 5.2 gives one a better feeling for these materials. Here *ε* is a small positive number introduced to quantify paramagnetic materials. Next, we describe these materials in some detail.

TABLE 5.2
| Diamagnetic | Paramagnetic | Ferromagnetic |
|---|---|---|
| -1 ≤ *χ* < 0 | 0 < *χ* < *ε* | *χ* >> 1 |
| 0 ≤ *μ_r* < 1 | 1 < *μ_r* < 1 + *ε* | *μ_r* >> 1 |
| *μ* < *μ_0* | *μ* > *μ_0* | *μ* >> *μ_0* |

### 5.5.1 Diamagnetism
Diamagnetic substances are those which have tendency to move from stronger to the weaker part of the external magnetic field. In other words, unlike the way a magnet attracts metals like iron, it would repel a diamagnetic substance.

Figure 5.7(a) shows a bar of diamagnetic material placed in an external magnetic field. The field lines are repelled or expelled and the field inside the material is reduced. In most cases, this reduction is slight, being one part in 10⁵. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from high to low field.

## Physics
The simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons in an atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum. These orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus possess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the ones in which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic field is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the same direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up. This happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz's law which you will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic moment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence repulsion.

Some diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon, nitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present in all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it gets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.

The most exotic diamagnetic materials are **superconductors**. These are metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both **perfect conductivity** and **perfect diamagnetism**. Here the field lines are completely expelled! `χ = -1` and `μ_r = 0`. A superconductor repels a magnet and (by Newton's third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfect diamagnetism in superconductors is called the *Meissner effect*, after the name of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfully exploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically levitated superfast trains.

### 5.5.2 Paramagnetism
Paramagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weakly attracted to a magnet.

The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) of a paramagnetic material possess a permanent magnetic dipole moment of their own. On account of the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation is seen. In the presence of an external field `B₀`, which is strong enough, and at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be made to align and point in the same direction as `B₀`. Figure 5.7(b) shows a bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field. The field lines gets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced. In most cases, this enhancement is slight, being one part in `10⁵`. When placed in a non-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from weak field to strong.

Some paramagnetic materials are aluminium, sodium, calcium, oxygen (at STP) and copper chloride. For a paramagnetic material both `χ` and `μᵣ` depend not only on the material, but also (in a simple fashion) on the sample temperature. As the field is increased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until it reaches the saturation value at which point all the dipoles are perfectly aligned with the field.

### 5.5.3 Ferromagnetism
Ferromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when placed in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to move from a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get strongly attracted to a magnet.

The individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material possess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they interact with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align themselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called *domain*. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum mechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each *domain* has a net magnetisation. Typical *domain* size is 1mm and the *domain* contains about 10¹¹ atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly from *domain* to *domain* and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown in Fig. 5.8(a). When we apply an external magnetic field B₀, the *domains* orient themselves in the direction of B₀ and simultaneously the *domain* oriented in the direction of B₀ grow in size. This existence of *domains* and their motion in B₀ are not speculations. One may observe this under a microscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered ferromagnetic substance of samples. This motion of suspension can be observed. Fig. 5.8(b) shows the situation when the *domains* have aligned and amalgamated to form a single 'giant' *domain*.

Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly concentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move towards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happens when the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials the magnetisation persists. Such materials are called **hard magnetic materials** or **hard ferromagnets**. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt and copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is another. Such materials form permanent magnets to be used among other things as a compass needle. On the other hand, there is a class of ferromagnetic materials in which the magnetisation disappears on removal of the external field. Soft iron is one such material. Appropriately enough, such materials are called **soft ferromagnetic materials**. There are a number of elements, which are ferromagnetic: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, etc. The relative magnetic permeability is >1000!

The ferromagnetic property depends on temperature. At high enough temperature, a ferromagnet becomes a paramagnet. The *domain* structure disintegrates with temperature. This disappearance of magnetisation with temperature is gradual.

### SUMMARY
1. The science of magnetism is old. It has been known since ancient times that magnetic materials tend to point in the north-south direction; like

magnetic poles repel and unlike ones attract; and cutting a bar magnet in two leads to two smaller magnets. Magnetic poles cannot be isolated.
2. When a bar magnet of dipole moment **m** is placed in a uniform magnetic field **B**,
    (a) the force on it is zero,
    (b) the torque on it is **m** × **B**,
    (c) its potential energy is -**m**·**B**, where we choose the zero of energy at the orientation when **m** is perpendicular to **B**.
3. Consider a bar magnet of size *l* and magnetic moment **m**, at a distance *r* from its mid-point, where *r*>>*l*, the magnetic field **B** due to this bar is,
    B = μ₀**m** / 2πr³ (along axis)
    = -μ₀**m** / 4πr³ (along equator)
4. Gauss's law for magnetism states that the net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero
    Φ_B = Σ_all area elements ΔS **B**·Δ**S** = 0
5. Consider a material placed in an external magnetic field **B₀**. The magnetic intensity is defined as,
    **H** = **B₀** / μ₀
    The magnetisation **M** of the material is its dipole moment per unit volume. The magnetic field **B** in the material is,
    **B** = μ₀ (**H** + **M**)
6. For a linear material **M** = χ **H**. So that **B** = μ **H** and χ is called the magnetic susceptibility of the material. The three quantities, χ, the relative magnetic permeability μ_r, and the magnetic permeability μ are related as follows:
    μ = μ₀μ_r

7. Magnetic materials are broadly classified as: diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic. For diamagnetic materials χ is negative and small and for paramagnetic materials it is positive and small. Ferromagnetic materials have large χ.
8. Substances, which at room temperature, retain their ferromagnetic property for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.

### POINTS TO PONDER

1.  A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving charges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological exploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific understanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is not a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science and engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in tandem.
2.  Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get two smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative charges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the electronic charge with value `|e| = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`. All other charges are integral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is quantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why electric charge is quantised.
3.  A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that the magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast, the electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate on the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).
4.  A miniscule difference in the value of χ, the magnetic susceptibility, yields radically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For diamagnetic materials χ = -10⁻⁵ whereas χ = +10⁻⁵ for paramagnetic materials.

# ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL AND CAPACITANCE

### 2.1 INTRODUCTION

In Chapters 5 and 7 (Class XI), the notion of potential energy was introduced. When an external force does work in taking a body from a point to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force, that work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external force is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing an equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and potential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called conservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of conservative forces.

Coulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative force. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence on distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants – the masses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’s law. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational field, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an electrostatic field.

Consider an electrostatic field **E** due to some charge configuration. First, for simplicity, consider the field **E** due to a charge *Q* placed at the origin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge *q* from a point R to a point P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge *Q*. With reference

FIGURE 2.1 A test charge *q* (> 0) is moved from the point R to the point P against the repulsive force on it by the charge *Q* (> 0) placed at the origin.

to Fig. 2.1, this will happen if *Q* and *q* are both positive or both negative. For definiteness, let us take *Q*, *q* > 0.

Two remarks may be made here. First, we assume that the test charge *q* is so small that it does not disturb the original configuration, namely the charge *Q* at the origin (or else, we keep *Q* fixed at the origin by some unspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge *q* from R to P, we apply an external force **F**_ext_ just enough to counter the repulsive electric force **F**_E_ (i.e, **F**_ext_ = -**F**_E_). This means there is no net force on or acceleration of the charge *q* when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is brought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In this situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work done by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential energy of the charge *q*. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the electric force will take the charge away from *Q* – the stored energy (potential energy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge *q* in such a way that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.

Thus, work done by external forces in moving a charge *q* from R to P is

$$
W_{RP} = \int_R^P \mathbf{F}_{ext} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
$$

$$
= - \int_R^P \mathbf{F}_E \cdot d\mathbf{r} \qquad (2.1)
$$

This work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored as potential energy.

At every point in electric field, a particle with charge *q* possesses a certain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential energy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points R and P.

Thus, potential energy difference

$$
\Delta U = U_P - U_R = W_{RP} \qquad (2.2)
$$

(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric force and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., -*W*_{RP}.)

Therefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between two points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving (without accelerating) charge *q* from one point to another for electric field of any arbitrary charge configuration.

Two important comments may be made at this stage:
(i) The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions of the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in moving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial and the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from one point to the other. This is the fundamental characteristic of a conservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be meaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence of work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the Coulomb's law. We omit this proof here.

(ii) Equation (2.2) defines *potential energy difference* in terms of the physically meaningful quantity *work*. Clearly, potential energy so defined is undetermined to within an additive constant. What this means is that the actual value of potential energy is not physically significant; it is only the difference of potential energy that is significant. We can always add an arbitrary constant α to potential energy at every point, since this will not change the potential energy difference:
$$(U_P + α) - (U_R + α) = U_P - U_R$$
Put it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point where potential energy is zero. A convenient choice is to have electrostatic potential energy zero at infinity. With this choice, if we take the point R at infinity, we get from Eq. (2.2)
$$W_{∞P} = U_P - U_∞ = U_P \quad (2.3)$$
Since the point P is arbitrary, Eq. (2.3) provides us with a definition of potential energy of a charge *q* at any point. Potential energy of charge *q* at a point (in the presence of field due to any charge configuration) is the work done by the external force (equal and opposite to the electric force) in bringing the charge *q* from infinity to that point.

## 2.2 ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL

Consider any general static charge configuration. We define potential energy of a test charge *q* in terms of the work done on the charge *q*. This work is obviously proportional to *q*, since the force at any point is **qE**, where **E** is the electric field at that point due to the given charge configuration. It is, therefore, convenient to divide the work by the amount of charge *q*, so that the resulting quantity is independent of *q*. In other words, work done per unit test charge is characteristic of the electric field associated with the charge configuration. This leads to the idea of electrostatic potential *V* due to a given charge configuration. From Eq. (2.1), we get:
Work done by external force in bringing a unit positive charge from point R to P
$$V_P - V_R = \frac{U_P - U_R}{q} \quad (2.4)$$
where *V*<sub>P</sub> and *V*<sub>R</sub> are the electrostatic potentials at P and R, respectively. Note, as before, that it is not the actual value of potential but the potential difference that is physically significant. If, as before, we choose the potential to be zero at infinity, Eq. (2.4) implies:
Work done by an external force in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to a point = electrostatic potential (*V*) at that point.

Italian physicist, professor at Pavia. Volta established that the *animal electricity* observed by Luigi Galvani, 1737-1798, in experiments with frog muscle tissue placed in contact with dissimilar metals, was not due to any exceptional property of animal tissues but was also generated whenever any wet body was sandwiched between dissimilar metals. This led him to develop the first *voltaic pile*, or battery, consisting of a large stack of moist disks of cardboard (electrolyte) sandwiched between disks of metal (electrodes).

## Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance

Equation (2.8) is true for any sign of the charge *Q*, though we considered *Q* > 0 in its derivation. For *Q* < 0, *V* < 0, i.e., work done (by the external force) per unit positive test charge in bringing it from infinity to the point is negative. This is equivalent to saying that work done by the electrostatic force in bringing the unit positive charge from infinity to the point P is positive. [This is as it should be, since for *Q* < 0, the force on a unit positive test charge is attractive, so that the electrostatic force and the displacement (from infinity to P) are in the same direction.] Finally, we note that Eq. (2.8) is consistent with the choice that potential at infinity be zero.

**FIGURE 2.4** Variation of potential *V* with *r* [in units of (*Q*/4πε₀) m⁻¹] (blue curve) and field with *r* [in units of (*Q*/4πε₀) m⁻²] (black curve) for a point charge *Q*.

Figure (2.4) shows how the electrostatic potential (∝ 1/*r*) and the electrostatic field (∝ 1/*r*²) varies with *r*.

### Example 2.1
(a) Calculate the potential at a point P due to a charge of 4 × 10⁻⁷C located 9 cm away.
(b) Hence obtain the work done in bringing a charge of 2 × 10⁻⁹ C from infinity to the point P. Does the answer depend on the path along which the charge is brought?

### Solution
(a) *V* = (1 / 4πε₀) (*Q* / *r*)
    = 9 × 10⁹ Nm² C⁻² × (4 × 10⁻⁷C / 0.09 m)
    = 4 × 10⁴ V

(b) *W* = *qV* = 2 × 10⁻⁹C × 4 × 10⁴V
    = 8 × 10⁻⁵ J
No, work done will be path independent. Any arbitrary infinitesimal path can be resolved into two perpendicular displacements: One along **r** and another perpendicular to **r**. The work done corresponding to the later will be zero.

## 2.4 POTENTIAL DUE TO AN ELECTRIC DIPOLE
As we learnt in the last chapter, an electric dipole consists of two charges **q** and **-q** separated by a (small) distance 2a. Its total charge is zero. It is characterised by a dipole moment vector **p** whose magnitude is **q × 2a** and which points in the direction from **-q** to **q** (Fig. 2.5). We also saw that the electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector **r** depends not just on the magnitude **r**, but also on the angle between **r** and **p**. Further,

The field falls off, at large distance, not as $1/r^2$ (typical of field due to a single charge) but as $1/r^3$. We, now, determine the electric potential due to a dipole and contrast it with the potential due to a single charge.

As before, we take the origin at the centre of the dipole. Now we know that the electric field obeys the superposition principle. Since potential is related to the work done by the field, electrostatic potential also follows the superposition principle. Thus, the potential due to the dipole is the sum of potentials due to the charges $q$ and $-q$.

$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left(\frac{q}{r_1} - \frac{q}{r_2}\right)$ (2.9)

where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the distances of the point P from $q$ and $-q$, respectively.

**FIGURE 2.5** Quantities involved in the calculation of potential due to a dipole.

Now, by geometry,
$r_1^2 = r^2 + a^2 - 2ar \cos\theta$
$r_2^2 = r^2 + a^2 + 2ar \cos\theta$ (2.10)

We take $r$ much greater than $a$ ($r \gg a$) and retain terms only upto the first order in $a/r$.

$r_1^2 = r^2 \left[1 - \frac{2a \cos\theta}{r} + \frac{a^2}{r^2}\right]$
$\approx r^2 \left[1 - \frac{2a \cos\theta}{r}\right]$ (2.11)

Similarly,
$r_2^2 = r^2 \left[1 + \frac{2a \cos\theta}{r}\right]$ (2.12)

Using the Binomial theorem and retaining terms upto the first order in $a/r$; we obtain,
$\frac{1}{r_1} \approx \frac{1}{r} \left[1 - \frac{2a \cos\theta}{r}\right]^{-1/2} \approx \frac{1}{r} \left[1 + \frac{a \cos\theta}{r}\right]$ [2.13(a)]

$\frac{1}{r_2} \approx \frac{1}{r} \left[1 + \frac{2a \cos\theta}{r}\right]^{-1/2} \approx \frac{1}{r} \left[1 - \frac{a \cos\theta}{r}\right]$ [2.13(b)]

Using Eqs. (2.9) and (2.13) and $p = 2qa$, we get

$V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{2a \cos\theta}{r^2} = \frac{p \cos\theta}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2}$ (2.14)

Now, $p \cos\theta = \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{r}}$

= 1 / (4πε₀) (q₁/r₁P + q₂/r₂P +......+ qn/rnP) (2.18)

If we have a continuous charge distribution characterised by a charge density ρ(**r**), we divide it, as before, into small volume elements each of size Δ*v* and carrying a charge ρΔ*v*. We then determine the potential due to each volume element and sum (strictly speaking, integrate) over all such contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire distribution.

We have seen in Chapter 1 that for a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated at the centre. Thus, the potential outside the shell is given by

V = 1 / (4πε₀) (q / r) (*r* ≥R) [2.19(a)]

where **q** is the total charge on the shell and **R** its radius. The electric field inside the shell is zero. This implies (Section 2.6) that potential is constant inside the shell (as no work is done in moving a charge inside the shell), and, therefore, equals its value at the surface, which is

V = 1 / (4πε₀) (q / R) [2.19(b)]

### Example 2.2
Two charges 3 × 10⁻⁸ C and –2 × 10⁻⁸ C are located 15 cm apart. At what point on the line joining the two charges is the electric potential zero? Take the potential at infinity to be zero.
**Solution** Let us take the origin O at the location of the positive charge. The line joining the two charges is taken to be the *x*-axis; the negative charge is taken to be on the right side of the origin (Fig. 2.7).

(Diagram of charges at O and A, with point P indicated and distances 3x10⁻⁸ C, 15 cm, -2x10⁻⁸ C)

FIGURE 2.7

Let P be the required point on the *x*-axis where the potential is zero. If *x* is the *x*-coordinate of P, obviously *x* must be positive. (There is no possibility of potentials due to the two charges adding up to zero for *x* < 0.) If *x* lies between O and A, we have

1 / (4πε₀) [ (3 ×10⁻⁸) / (*x*×10⁻²) - (2 ×10⁻⁸) / ((15-*x*) ×10⁻²) ] = 0

where *x* is in cm. That is,

3 / *x* - 2 / (15-*x*) = 0

which gives *x* = 9 cm.

If *x* lies on the extended line OA, the required condition is

3 / *x* - 2 / (*x*-15) = 0

which gives
`x = 45 cm`
Thus, electric potential is zero at 9 cm and 45 cm away from the positive charge on the side of the negative charge. Note that the formula for potential used in the calculation required choosing potential to be zero at infinity.

**Questions:**
(a) Give the signs of the potential difference `V_P - V_Q`; `V_B - V_A`.
(b) Give the sign of the potential energy difference of a small negative charge between the points `Q` and `P`; `A` and `B`.
(c) Give the sign of the work done by the field in moving a small positive charge from `Q` to `P`.
(d) Give the sign of the work done by the external agency in moving a small negative charge from `B` to `A`.
(e) Does the kinetic energy of a small negative charge increase or decrease in going from `B` to `A`?

### Solution

(a) As `V \propto 1/r`, `V_P > V_Q`. Thus, `(V_P - V_Q)` is positive. Also `V_B` is less negative than `V_A`. Thus, `V_B > V_A` or `(V_B - V_A)` is positive.
(b) A small negative charge will be attracted towards positive charge. The negative charge moves from higher potential energy to lower potential energy. Therefore the sign of potential energy difference of a small negative charge between `Q` and `P` is positive.
    Similarly, `(P.E.)_A > (P.E.)_B` and hence sign of potential energy differences is positive.
(c) In moving a small positive charge from `Q` to `P`, work has to be done by an external agency against the electric field. Therefore, work done by the field is negative.
(d) In moving a small negative charge from `B` to `A` work has to be done by the external agency. It is positive.
(e) Due to force of repulsion on the negative charge, velocity decreases and hence the kinetic energy decreases in going from `B` to `A`.

### 2.6 EQUIPOTENTIAL SURFACES

An equipotential surface is a surface with a constant value of potential at all points on the surface. For a single charge q, the potential is given by Eq. (2.8):

$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o} \frac{q}{r}$

This shows that V is a constant if r is constant. Thus, equipotential surfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred at the charge.

Now the electric field lines for a single charge q are radial lines starting from or ending at the charge, depending on whether q is positive or negative. Clearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface passing through that point. This is true in general: *for any charge configuration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the electric field at that point*. The proof of this statement is simple.

If the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would have non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge against the direction of the component of the field, work would have to be done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential surface: there is no potential difference between any two points on the surface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface. The electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface at every point. Equipotential surfaces offer an alternative visual picture in addition to the picture of electric field lines around a charge configuration.

FIGURE 2.9 For a single charge q
- (a) equipotential surfaces are spherical surfaces centred at the charge, and
- (b) electric field lines are radial, starting from the charge if q > 0.

FIGURE 2.10 Equipotential surfaces for a uniform electric field.

For a uniform electric field *E*, say, along the x-axis, the equipotential surfaces are planes normal to the x-axis, i.e., planes parallel to the y-z plane (Fig. 2.10). Equipotential surfaces for (a) a dipole and (b) two identical positive charges are shown in Fig. 2.11.

## 2.6.1 Relation between field and potential

Consider two closely spaced equipotential surfaces A and B (Fig. 2.12) with potential values V and V + δV, where δV is the change in V in the direction of the electric field **E**. Let P be a point on the surface B. δl is the perpendicular distance of the surface A from P. Imagine that a unit positive charge is moved along this perpendicular from the surface B to surface A against the electric field. The work done in this process is |**E**|δl.

This work equals the potential difference V_A - V_B.

Thus,
|**E**|δl = V - (V + δV) = -δV

i.e., |**E**| = - δV / δl (2.20)

Since δV is negative, δV = -|δV|. we can rewrite Eq (2.20) as

|**E**| = - δV / δl = + |δV| / δl (2.21)

FIGURE 2.12 From the potential to the field.

We thus arrive at two important conclusions concerning the relation between electric field and potential:
1.  Electric field is in the direction in which the potential decreases *steepest*.
2.  *Its magnitude is given by the change in the magnitude of potential per unit displacement normal to the equipotential surface at the point*.

## 2.7 POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SYSTEM OF CHARGES

Consider first the simple case of two charges *q₁* and *q₂* with position vector **r₁** and **r₂** relative to some origin. Let us calculate the work done (externally) in building up this configuration. This means that we consider the charges *q₁* and *q₂* initially at infinity and determine the work done by an external agency to bring the charges to the given locations. Suppose, first the charge *q₁* is brought from infinity to the point **r₁**. There is no external field against which work needs to be done, so work done in bringing *q₁* from infinity to **r₁** is zero. This charge produces a potential in space given by

V₁ = 1 / (4πε₀ * r₁P)

where *r₁P* is the distance of a point P in space from the location of *q₁*. From the definition of potential, work done in bringing charge *q₂* from infinity to the point **r₂** is *q₂* times the potential at **r₂** due to *q₁*:

(b) A charge q₀ is brought to the centre E of the square, the four charges being held fixed at its corners. How much extra work is needed to do this?

FIGURE 2.15

### Solution
(a) Since the work done depends on the final arrangement of the charges, and not on how they are put together, we calculate work needed for one way of putting the charges at A, B, C and D. Suppose, first the charge +q is brought to A, and then the charges –q, +q, and -q are brought to B, C and D, respectively. The total work needed can be calculated in steps:
(i) Work needed to bring charge +q to A when no charge is present elsewhere: this is zero.
(ii) Work needed to bring -q to B when +q is at A. This is given by (charge at B) × (electrostatic potential at B due to charge +q at A)
= -q × q / (4πε₀d) = -q² / (4πε₀d)

(iii) Work needed to bring charge +q to C when +q is at A and -q is at B. This is given by (charge at C) × (potential at C due to charges at A and B)
= +q [ +q / (4πε₀d√2) + -q / (4πε₀d) ]
= -q² / (4πε₀d) [ 1 - 1/√2 ]

(iv) Work needed to bring -q to D when +q at A,-q at B, and +q at C. This is given by (charge at D) × (potential at D due to charges at A, B and C)
= -q [ +q / (4πε₀d) + -q / (4πε₀d√2) + q / (4πε₀d) ]
= -q² / (4πε₀d) [ 2 - 1/√2 ]

(a) U = $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r} = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{7 \times (-2) \times 10^{-12}}{0.18} = -0.7$ J.

**EXAMPLE 2.5**

(b) W = U₂ - U₁ = 0 - U = 0 - (-0.7) = 0.7 J.
(c) The mutual interaction energy of the two charges remains unchanged. In addition, there is the energy of interaction of the two charges with the external electric field. We find,
q₁V (**r**₁) + q₂V (**r**₂) = A $\frac{7\mu C}{0.09m}$ + A $\frac{-2\mu C}{0.09m}$
and the net electrostatic energy is
q₁V (**r**₁) + q₂V (**r**₂) + $\frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r_{12}}$ = A $\frac{7\mu C}{0.09m}$ + A $\frac{-2\mu C}{0.09m}$ -0.7 J
= 70 -20 -0.7 = 49.3 J.

### 2.8.3 Potential energy of a dipole in an external field
Consider a dipole with charges q₁ = +q and q₂ = –q placed in a uniform electric field **E**, as shown in Fig. 2.16.

As seen in the last chapter, in a uniform electric field, the dipole experiences no net force; but experiences a torque τ given by
**τ = p x E** (2.30)
which will tend to rotate it (unless **p** is parallel or antiparallel to **E**). Suppose an external torque τ$_{ext}$ is applied in such a manner that it just neutralises this torque and rotates it in the plane of paper from angle θ₀ to angle θ₁ at an infinitesimal angular speed and *without* angular acceleration. The amount of work done by the external torque will be given by
W = $\int_{\theta_0}^{\theta_1} \tau_{ext}(\theta)d\theta = \int_{\theta_0}^{\theta_1} pE \sin\theta d\theta$
= pE (cos θ₀ - cos θ₁) (2.31)

This work is stored as the potential energy of the system. We can then associate potential energy U(θ) with an inclination θ of the dipole. Similar to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing the angle where the potential energy U is taken to be zero. A natural choice is to take θ₀ = π / 2. (An explanation for it is provided towards the end of discussion.) We can then write,
U (θ) = pE ($\cos\frac{\pi}{2} - \cos\theta$) = pEcosθ = **-p.E** (2.32)

## Physics

the situation in this case is more involved – the movement of the charge carriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by the so-called chemical forces (see Chapter 3). We shall restrict our discussion to metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding electrostatics of conductors.

### 1. **Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero**

Consider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external electrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside or on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere inside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a conductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not zero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the static situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the electric field is zero everywhere inside. *Electrostatic field is zero inside a conductor.*

### 2. **At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field must be normal to the surface at every point**

If **E** were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero component along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor would then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore, **E** should have no tangential component. Thus *electrostatic field at the surface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every point.* (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero even at the surface.) See result 5.

### 3. **The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in the static situation**

A neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges in every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged, the excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation. This follows from the Gauss's law. Consider any arbitrary volume element *v* inside a conductor. On the closed surface S bounding the volume element *v*, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S is zero. Hence, by Gauss's law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But the surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume *v* can be made vanishingly small. This means *there is no net charge at any point inside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface*.

### 4. **Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume of the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on its surface**

This follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since **E** = 0 inside the conductor and has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in moving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That is, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on the surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged,

## 2.10 DIELECTRICS AND POLARISATION

Dielectrics are non-conducting substances. In contrast to conductors, they have no (or negligible number of) charge carriers. Recall from Section 2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an external electric field. The free charge carriers move and charge distribution in the conductor adjusts itself in such a way that the electric field due to induced charges opposes the external field within the conductor. This happens until, in the static situation, the two fields cancel each other and the net electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a dielectric, this free movement of charges is not possible. It turns out that the external field induces dipole moment by stretching or re-orienting molecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all the molecular dipole moments is net charges on the surface of the dielectric which produce a field that opposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor, however, the opposing field so induced does not exactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it. The extent of the effect depends on the nature of the dielectric. To understand the effect, we need to look at the charge distribution of a dielectric at the molecular level.

FIGURE 2.20 Difference in behaviour of a conductor and a dielectric in an external electric field.

E₀, σ, E_in, σ_p, E₀ + E_in ≠ 0, Dielectric

The molecules of a substance may be polar or non-polar. In a non-polar molecule, the centres of positive and negative charges coincide. The molecule then has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole moment. Examples of non-polar molecules are oxygen (O₂) and hydrogen (H₂) molecules which, because of their symmetry, have no dipole moment. On the other hand, a polar molecule is one in which the centres of positive and negative charges are separated (even when there is no external field). Such molecules have a permanent dipole moment. An ionic molecule such as HCl or a molecule of water (H₂O) are examples of polar molecules.

In an external electric field, the positive and negative charges of a non-polar molecule are displaced in opposite directions. The displacement stops when the external force on the constituent charges of the molecule is balanced by the restoring force (due to internal fields in the molecule). The non-polar molecule thus develops an induced dipole moment. The dielectric is said to be polarised by the external field. We consider only the simple situation when the induced dipole moment is in the direction of the field and is proportional to the field strength. (Substances for which this assumption is true are called *linear isotropic dielectrics*.) The induced dipole moments of different molecules add up giving a net dipole moment of the dielectric in the presence of the external field.

A dielectric with polar molecules also develops a net dipole moment in an external field, but for a different reason. In the absence of any external field, the different permanent dipoles are oriented randomly due to thermal agitation; so the total dipole moment is zero. When an external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend to align with the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net dipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is polarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of two mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external field tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending to disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the ‘induced dipole moment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment effect is more important for polar molecules.

Thus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops a net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole moment per unit volume is called *polarisation* and is denoted by **P**. For linear isotropic dielectrics,

**P** = ε₀χₑ **E** (2.37)

where χₑ is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the *electric susceptibility* of the dielectric medium.

It is possible to relate χₑ to the molecular properties of the substance, but we shall not pursue that here.

The question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original external field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular dielectric slab placed in a uniform external field **E₀** parallel to two of its faces. The field causes a uniform polarisation **P** of the dielectric. Thus

# Page Number: 79
## Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance

every volume element Δ*v* of the slab has a dipole moment **P**Δ*v* in the direction of the field. The volume element Δ*v* is macroscopically small but contains a very large number of molecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the volume element Δ*v* has no net charge (though it has net dipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one dipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole. However, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the electric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen in Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain unneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at the left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced charges due to the external field.

Thus, the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged surfaces with induced surface charge densities, say σ*p* and -σ*p*. Clearly, the field produced by these surface charges opposes the external field. The total field in the dielectric is, thereby, reduced from the case when no dielectric is present. We should note that the surface charge density ±σ*p* arises from bound (not free charges) in the dielectric.

FIGURE 2.23 A uniformly polarised dielectric amounts to induced surface charge density, but no volume charge density.

## 2.11 CAPACITORS AND CAPACITANCE

A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator (Fig. 2.24). The conductors have charges, say *Q*₁ and *Q*₂, and potentials *V*₁ and *V*₂. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges *Q* and –*Q*, with potential difference *V* = *V*₁ – *V*₂ between them. We shall consider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a single conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at infinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the two terminals of a battery. *Q* is called the charge of the capacitor, though this, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge of the capacitor is zero.

The electric field in the region between the conductors is proportional to the charge *Q*. That is, if the charge on the capacitor is, say doubled, the electric field will also be doubled at every point. (This follows from the direct proportionality between field and charge implied by Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.) Now, potential difference *V* is the work done per unit positive charge in taking a small test charge from the conductor 2 to 1 against the field. Consequently, *V* is also proportional to *Q*, and the ratio *Q*/*V* is a constant:

C = *Q*/*V* (2.38)

The constant C is called the *capacitance* of the capacitor. C is independent of *Q* or *V*, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on the

FIGURE 2.24 A system of two conductors separated by an insulator forms a capacitor.
n ---------------------------- 

# Page Number: 80
## Physics

geometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of two conductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the insulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.] The SI unit of capacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt⁻¹) or 1 F = 1 C V⁻¹. A capacitor with fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as | |, while the one with variable capacitance is shown as ⫽.

Equation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This means a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge Q at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential difference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong electric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so produced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge on the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the capacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the intervening medium.

The maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand without break-down (of its insulating property) is called its *dielectric strength*; for air it is about 3 × 10⁶ Vm⁻¹. For a separation between conductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential difference of 3 × 10⁴ V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to store a large amount of charge without leaking, its capacitance should be high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric field do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit to the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without significant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common units are its sub-multiples 1 µF = 10⁻⁶ F, 1 nF = 10⁻⁹ F, 1 pF = 10⁻¹² F, etc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most ac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.

### 2.12 THE PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR

A parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting plates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take the intervening medium between the plates to be vacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between the plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be the area of each plate and d the separation between them. The two plates have charges Q and -Q. Since d is much smaller than the linear dimension of the plates (d² << A), we can use the result on electric field by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface charge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface charge density σ = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface charge density –σ. Using Eq. (1.33), the electric field in different regions is:

## CURRENT ELECTRICITY

### 3.1 INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at rest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur naturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in which charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere, sometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not steady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow in a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a cell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we shall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.

### 3.2 ELECTRIC CURRENT
Imagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both the positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward across the area. In a given time interval *t*, let *q*+ be the net amount (i.e., forward *minus* backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward direction across the area. Similarly, let *q*_ be the net amount of negative charge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount of charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time interval *t*, then, is *q* = *q*+– *q*_. This is proportional to *t* for steady current

time more than τ and some less than τ. In other words, the time *t* in Eq. (3.16) will be less than τ for some and more than τ for others as we go through the values of *i* = 1, 2 ..... *N*. The average value of *t* then is τ (known as *relaxation time*). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over the *N*-electrons at any given time *t* gives us for the average velocity *v*<sub>d</sub>

*v*<sub>d</sub> = (*v*<sub>*i*</sub>)<sub>average</sub> = (*v*<sub>*i*</sub>)<sub>average</sub> - ( *e**E* / *m* )(*t*<sub>*i*</sub>)<sub>average</sub>
= 0 - ( *e**E* / *m* )τ = - ( *e**E* / *m* )τ (3.17)

FIGURE 3.4 Current in a metallic conductor. The magnitude of current density in a metal is the magnitude of charge contained in a cylinder of unit area and length *v*<sub>d</sub>.

This last result is surprising. It tells us that the electrons move with an average velocity which is independent of time, although electrons are accelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the velocity *v*<sub>d</sub> in Eq. (3.17) is called the **drift velocity**.
Because of the drift, there will be net transport of charges across any area perpendicular to **E**. Consider a planar area *A*, located inside the conductor such that the normal to the area is parallel to **E** (Fig. 3.4). Then because of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time Δ*t*, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto |*v*<sub>d</sub>|Δ*t* would have crossed the area. If *n* is the number of free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then there are *n*Δ*t*|*v*<sub>d</sub>|*A* such electrons. Since each electron carries a charge –*e*, the total charge transported across this area *A* to the right in time Δ*t* is –*ne* *A*|*v*<sub>d</sub>|Δ*t*. **E** is directed towards the left and hence the total charge transported along **E** across the area is negative of this. The amount of charge crossing the area *A* in time Δ*t* is by definition [Eq. (3.2)] *I* Δ*t*, where *I* is the magnitude of the current. Hence,

*I*Δ*t* = +*ne* *A* |*v*<sub>d</sub>|Δ*t* (3.18)

Substituting the value of |*v*<sub>d</sub>| from Eq. (3.17)

*I*Δ*t* = (*e*<sup>2</sup> *A* / *m*) τ*n*Δ*t*|**E**| (3.19)

By definition *I* is related to the magnitude |*j*| of the current density by
*I* = |*j*|*A* (3.20)

Hence, from Eqs. (3.19) and (3.20),

|*j*| = (*ne*<sup>2</sup> / *m*) τ|**E**| (3.21)

The vector **j** is parallel to **E** and hence we can write Eq. (3.21) in the vector form

**j** = (*ne*<sup>2</sup> / *m*) τ**E** (3.22)

Comparison with Eq. (3.13) shows that Eq. (3.22) is exactly the Ohm's law, if we identify the conductivity *σ* as

$\sigma = \frac{ne^2 \tau}{m}$ (3.23)

We thus see that a very simple picture of electrical conduction reproduces Ohm's law. We have, of course, made assumptions that $\tau$ and $n$ are constants, independent of $E$. We shall, in the next section, discuss the limitations of Ohm's law.

### **Example 3.1**
(a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction electrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ m² carrying a current of 1.5 A. Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly one conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 × 10³ kg/m³, and its atomic mass is 63.5 u.
(b) Compare the drift speed obtained above with,
    (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary temperatures,
    (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the conductor which causes the drift motion.

### Solution
(a) The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite to the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction of increasing potential. The drift speed *v*d is given by Eq. (3.18)
    *v*d = (I/neA)
    Now, e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C, A = 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ m², I = 1.5 A. The density of conduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubic metre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is reasonable from its valence electron count of one). A cubic metre of copper has a mass of 9.0 × 10³ kg. Since 6.0 × 10²³ copper atoms have a mass of 63.5 g,
    $n = \frac{6.0 \times 10^{23}}{63.5} \times 9.0 \times 10^6$
    $ = 8.5 \times 10^{28} \text{ m}^{-3}$
    which gives,
    $v_d = \frac{1.5}{8.5 \times 10^{28} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 1.0 \times 10^{-7}}$
    $ = 1.1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m s}^{-1} = 1.1 \text{ mm s}^{-1}$

(b) (i) At a temperature T, the thermal speed* of a copper atom of mass M is obtained from [< (1/2) Mv² > = (3/2) k*B*T ] and is thus typically of the order of $\sqrt{k_B T/M}$, where k*B* is the Boltzmann constant. For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 × 10² m/s. This figure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms in a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much smaller, about 10⁻⁵ times the typical thermal speed at ordinary temperatures.
    (ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of an electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 × 10⁸ m s⁻¹ (You will learn about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in comparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10⁻¹¹.

### Example 3.2

(a) In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only a few mm s⁻¹ for currents in the range of a few amperes? How then is current established almost the instant a circuit is closed?
(b) The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons in the electric field inside the conductor. But force should cause acceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average drift speed?
(c) If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron's charge is small, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a conductor?
(d) When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential, does it mean that all the 'free' electrons of the metal are moving in the same direction?
(e) Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive collisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of electric field, (ii) presence of electric field?

### Solution
(a) Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly (with the speed of light) causing at every point a *local electron drift*. Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons from one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However, it does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value.
(b) Each 'free' electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until it collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed after collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed again only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average, therefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed.
(c) Simple, because the electron number density is enormous, ~10²⁹ m⁻³.
(d) By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large random velocities of electrons.
(e) In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the presence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved.

### 3.5.1 Mobility

As we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In metals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they are electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be both positive and negative ions.

An important quantity is the *mobility* μ defined as the magnitude of the drift velocity per unit electric field:

μ = |Vd| / E (3.24)

The SI unit of mobility is m²/Vs and is 10⁴ of the mobility in practical units (cm²/Vs). Mobility is positive. From Eq. (3.17), we have

Vd = eτE / m

Hence,

$\mu = \frac{v_d}{E} = \frac{e\tau}{m}$ (3.25)

where $\tau$ is the average collision time for electrons.

## 3.6 LIMITATIONS OF OHM'S LAW

Although Ohm's law has been found valid over a large class of materials, there do exist materials and devices used in electric circuits where the proportionality of V and I does not hold. The deviations broadly are one or more of the following types:

- (a) V ceases to be proportional to I (Fig. 3.5).

FIGURE 3.5 The dashed line represents the linear Ohm's law. The solid line is the voltage V versus current I for a good conductor.

- (b) The relation between V and I depends on the sign of V. In other words, if I is the current for a certain V, then reversing the direction of V keeping its magnitude fixed, does not produce a current of the same magnitude as I in the opposite direction (Fig. 3.6). This happens, for example, in a diode which we will study in Chapter 14.

FIGURE 3.6 Characteristic curve of a diode. Note the different scales for negative and positive values of the voltage and current.

FIGURE 3.7 Variation of current versus voltage for GaAs.

- (c) The relation between V and I is not unique, i.e., there is more than one value of V for the same current I (Fig. 3.7). A material exhibiting such behaviour is GaAs.

Materials and devices not obeying Ohm's law in the form of Eq. (3.3) are actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few subsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in materials that obey Ohm's law.

## 3.7 RESISTIVITY OF VARIOUS MATERIALS

The materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators depending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values.

Reprint 2025-26

# Page Number: 96
## Physics

Metals have low resistivities in the range of 10⁻⁸ Ωm to 10⁻⁶ Ωm. At the other end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having resistivities 10¹⁸ times greater than metals or more. In between the two are the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities characteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities of semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable impurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for electronic devices.

### 3.8 TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF RESISTIVITY

The resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature. Different materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures. Over a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity of a metallic conductor is approximately given by,

ρT = ρ₀ [1 + α (T-T₀)] (3.26)

where ρT is the resistivity at a temperature T and ρ₀ is the same at a reference temperature T₀. α is called the *temperature co-efficient of resistivity*, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of α is (Temperature)⁻¹. For metals, α is positive.

The relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of ρT plotted against T would be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph, however, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 3.8).

Equation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range of T around any reference temperature T₀, where the graph can be approximated as a straight line.

Resistivity ρT of copper as a function of temperature T.

**FIGURE 3.9** Resistivity ρT of nichrome as a function of absolute temperature T.

**FIGURE 3.10**

Some materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and chromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature (Fig. 3.9). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These materials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since their resistance values would change very little with temperatures.

## Current Electricity

Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with increasing temperatures. A typical dependence is shown in Fig. 3.10.
We can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of resistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation, resistivity of a material is given by

ρ = 1/σ = m/(ne²τ) (3.27)

ρ thus depends inversely both on the number *n* of free electrons per unit volume and on the average time τ between collisions. As we increase temperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of current, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time of collisions τ, thus decreases with temperature.
In a metal, *n* is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable extent and thus the decrease in the value of τ with rise in temperature causes ρ to increase as we have observed.
For insulators and semiconductors, however, *n* increases with temperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in τ in Eq.(3.23) so that for such materials, ρ decreases with temperature.

### Example 3.3

An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating element. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its resistance at room temperature (27.0 °C) is found to be 75.3 Ω. When the toaster is connected to a 230 V supply, the current settles, after a few seconds, to a steady value of 2.68 A. What is the steady temperature of the nichrome element? The temperature coefficient of resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range involved, is 1.70 × 10⁻⁴ °C⁻¹.

#### Solution

When the current through the element is very small, heating effects can be ignored and the temperature T₁ of the element is the same as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the supply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value of 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature will rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight decrease in current. In a few seconds, a steady state will be reached when temperature will rise no further, and both the resistance of the element and the current drawn will achieve steady values. The resistance R₂ at the steady temperature T₂ is

R₂ = 230 V / 2.68 A = 85.8 Ω

Using the relation
R₂ = R₁ [1 + α (T₂ – T₁)]
with α = 1.70 × 10⁻⁴ °C⁻¹, we get

T₂ - T₁ = (85.8 - 75.3) / (75.3 × 1.70 × 10⁻⁴) = 820 °C

that is, T₂ = (820 + 27.0) °C = 847 °C
Thus, the steady temperature of the heating element (when heating effect due to the current equals heat loss to the surroundings) is 847 °C.

## Current Electricity

Using Ohm's law *V* = *IR*, we get
*P* = *I*² *R* = *V*²/ *R* (3.33)

as the power loss (""ohmic loss"") in a conductor of resistance *R* carrying a current *I*. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an electric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.

Where does the power come from? As we have reasoned before, we need an external source to keep a steady current through the conductor. It is clearly this source which must supply this power. In the simple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.11), it is the chemical energy of the cell which supplies this power for as long as it can.

The expressions for power, Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33), show the dependence of the power dissipated in a resistor *R* on the current through it and the voltage across it.

FIGURE 3.11 Heat is produced in the resistor *R* which is connected across the terminals of a cell. The energy dissipated in the resistor *R* comes from the chemical energy of the electrolyte.

Equation (3.33) has an important application to power transmission. Electrical power is transmitted from power stations to homes and factories, which may be hundreds of miles away, via transmission cables. One obviously wants to minimise the power loss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes and factories. We shall see now how this can be achieved. Consider a device *R*, to which a power *P* is to be delivered via transmission cables having a resistance *R*<sub>c</sub> to be dissipated by it finally. If *V* is the voltage across *R* and *I* the current through it, then

*P* = *VI* (3.34)

The connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite resistance *R*<sub>c</sub>. The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is wasted is *P*<sub>c</sub> with

*P*<sub>c</sub> = *I*² *R*<sub>c</sub>

*P*<sub>c</sub> = *P*² *R*<sub>c</sub> / *V*² (3.35)

from Eq. (3.32). Thus, to drive a device of power *P*, the power wasted in the connecting wires is inversely proportional to *V*². The transmission cables from power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance *R*<sub>c</sub> is considerable. To reduce *P*<sub>c</sub>, these wires carry current at enormous values of *V* and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission lines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using electricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device called a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use.

### 3.10 CELLS, EMF, INTERNAL RESISTANCE

We have already mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady current in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell has two electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown in

FIGURE 3.12 (a) Sketch of an electrolyte cell with positive terminal P and negative terminal N. The gap between the electrodes is exaggerated for clarity. A and B are points in the electrolyte typically close to P and N. (b) the symbol for a cell, + referring to P and - referring to the N electrode. Electrical connections to the cell are made at P and N.

Fig. 3.12. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in the solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte. The positive electrode has a potential difference *V*+ (*V*+ > 0) between itself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked A in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative potential – (*V*_) (*V*\_ ≥ 0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it, marked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte has the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference between P and N is *V*+ – (–*V*_) = *V*+ + *V*_. This difference is called the **electromotive force (emf)** of the cell and is denoted by ε. Thus

ε = *V*+ + *V*\_ > 0 (3.36)

Note that ε is, actually, a potential difference and **not a force**. The name emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was given at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.

To understand the significance of ε, consider a resistor *R* connected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current *I* flows across *R* from C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained because current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly, across the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte but from N to P, whereas through *R*, it flows from P to N.

The electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite resistance *r*, called the **internal resistance**. Consider first the situation when *R* is infinite so that *I* = *V*/R = 0, where *V* is the potential difference between P and N. Now,
*V* = Potential difference between P and A
+ Potential difference between A and B
+ Potential difference between B and N
= ε (3.37)

Thus, emf ε is the potential difference between the positive and negative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is flowing through the cell.

If however *R* is finite, *I* is not zero. In that case the potential difference between P and N is
*V* = *V*+ + *V*\_ – *Ir*
= ε – *Ir* (3.38)

Note the negative sign in the expression (*Ir*) for the potential difference between A and B. This is because the current *I* flows from B to A in the electrolyte.

In practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit may be neglected when the current *I* is such that ε >> *Ir*. The actual values of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal resistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common electrolytic cells.

We also observe that since *V* is the potential difference across *R*, we have from Ohm's law
*V* = *I R* (3.39)

Combining Eqs. (3.38) and (3.39), we get

## Current Electricity

I R = ε - I r
Or, I = ε / (R + r) (3.40)

The maximum current that can be drawn from a cell is for R = 0
and it is I_max = ε/r. However, in most cells the maximum allowed current
is much lower than this to prevent permanent damage to the cell.

## 3.11 CELLS IN SERIES AND IN PARALLEL

Like resistors, cells can be combined together in an electric circuit. And
like resistors, one can, for calculating currents and voltages in a circuit,
replace a combination of cells by an equivalent cell.

FIGURE 3.13 Two cells of emf's ε₁ and ε₂ in the series. r₁, r₂ are their
internal resistances. For connections across A and C, the combination
can be considered as one cell of emf ε_eq and an internal resistance r_eq.

Consider first two cells in series (Fig. 3.13), where one terminal of the
two cells is joined together leaving the other terminal in either cell free.
ε₁, ε₂ are the emf's of the two cells and r₁, r₂ their internal resistances,
respectively.
Let V(A), V(B), V(C) be the potentials at points A, B and C shown in
Fig. 3.13. Then V(A) – V(B) is the potential difference between the positive
and negative terminals of the first cell. We have already calculated it in
Eq. (3.38) and hence,

V_AB = V(A) - V(B) = ε₁ – I r₁ (3.41)

Similarly,

V_BC = V(B) – V(C) = ε₂ − I r₂ (3.42)

Hence, the potential difference between the terminals A and C of
the combination is

V_AC = V(A) – V(C) = V(A) - V(B) + V(B) - V(C)
= (ε₁ + ε₂) - I(r₁ + r₂) (3.43)

If we wish to replace the combination by a single cell between A and
C of emf ε_eq and internal resistance r_eq, we would have

V_AC = ε_eq - I r_eq (3.44)

Comparing the last two equations, we get

ε_eq = ε₁ + ε₂ (3.45)
and r_eq = r₁ + r₂ (3.46)

In Fig.3.13, we had connected the negative electrode of the first to the
positive electrode of the second. If instead we connect the two negatives,

## Physics

Eq. (3.42) would change to $V_{BC} = -\epsilon_2 - Ir_2$ and we will get
$\epsilon_{eq} = \epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2 \quad (\epsilon_1 > \epsilon_2)$ (3.47)
The rule for series combination clearly can be extended to any number of cells:
(i) The equivalent emf of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of their individual emf’s, and
(ii) The equivalent internal resistance of a series combination of n cells is just the sum of their internal resistances.

This is so, when the current leaves each cell from the positive electrode. If in the combination, the current leaves any cell from the *negative* electrode, the emf of the cell enters the expression for $\epsilon_{eq}$ with a negative sign, as in Eq. (3.47).
Next, consider a parallel combination of the cells (Fig. 3.14). $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents leaving the positive electrodes of the cells. At the point $B_1$, $I_1$ and $I_2$ flow in whereas the current $I$ flows out. Since as much charge flows in as out, we have
$I = I_1 + I_2$ (3.48)
Let $V(B_1)$ and $V(B_2)$ be the potentials at $B_1$ and $B_2$, respectively. Then, considering the first cell, the potential difference across its terminals is $V(B_1) - V(B_2)$. Hence, from Eq. (3.38)
$V = V(B_1) - V(B_2) = \epsilon_1 - I_1r_1$ (3.49)
Points $B_1$ and $B_2$ are connected exactly similarly to the second cell. Hence considering the second cell, we also have
$V = V(B_1) - V(B_2) = \epsilon_2 - I_2r_2$ (3.50)
Combining the last three equations
$I = I_1 + I_2$
$= \frac{\epsilon_1 - V}{r_1} + \frac{\epsilon_2 - V}{r_2}$
$= \frac{\epsilon_1}{r_1} + \frac{\epsilon_2}{r_2} - V \left(\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2}\right)$ (3.51)

FIGURE 3.14 Two cells in parallel. For connections across A and C, the combination can be replaced by one cell of emf $\epsilon_{eq}$ and internal resistances $r_{eq}$ whose values are given in Eqs. (3.54) and (3.55).

Hence, V is given by,
$V = \frac{\epsilon_1 r_2 + \epsilon_2 r_1}{r_1 + r_2} - I \frac{r_1 r_2}{r_1 + r_2}$ (3.52)
If we want to replace the combination by a single cell, between $B_1$ and $B_2$, of emf $\epsilon_{eq}$ and internal resistance $r_{eq}$, we would have
$V = \epsilon_{eq} - I r_{eq}$ (3.53)
The last two equations should be the same and hence
$\epsilon_{eq} = \frac{\epsilon_1 r_2 + \epsilon_2 r_1}{r_1 + r_2}$ (3.54)
$r_{eq} = \frac{r_1 r_2}{r_1 + r_2}$ (3.55)
We can put these equations in a simpler way,

## Current Electricity

$$ \frac{1}{r_{eq}} = \frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2} \quad (3.56) $$

$$ \frac{\epsilon_{eq}}{r_{eq}} = \frac{\epsilon_1}{r_1} + \frac{\epsilon_2}{r_2} \quad (3.57) $$

In Fig. (3.14), we had joined the positive terminals together and similarly the two negative ones, so that the currents I₁, I₂ flow out of positive terminals. If the negative terminal of the second is connected to positive terminal of the first, Eqs. (3.56) and (3.57) would still be valid with `ε₂ → -ε₂`

Equations (3.56) and (3.57) can be extended easily. If there are n cells of emf `ε₁,... εₙ` and of internal resistances `r₁,... rₙ` respectively, connected in parallel, the combination is equivalent to a single cell of emf `ε_eq` and internal resistance `r_eq`, such that

$$ \frac{1}{r_{eq}} = \frac{1}{r_1} + ... + \frac{1}{r_n} \quad (3.58) $$

$$ \frac{\epsilon_{eq}}{r_{eq}} = \frac{\epsilon_1}{r_1} + ... + \frac{\epsilon_n}{r_n} \quad (3.59) $$

GUSTAV ROBERT KIRCHHOFF (1824 – 1887)

**Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824 – 1887)** German physicist, professor at Heidelberg and at Berlin. Mainly known for his development of spectroscopy, he also made many important contributions to mathematical physics, among them, his first and second rules for circuits.

### 3.12 KIRCHHOFF'S RULES

Electric circuits generally consist of a number of resistors and cells interconnected sometimes in a complicated way. The formulae we have derived earlier for series and parallel combinations of resistors are not always sufficient to determine all the currents and potential differences in the circuit. Two rules, called *Kirchhoff's rules*, are very useful for analysis of electric circuits.

Given a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a symbol, say *I*, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current *I* flows along the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately *I* is determined to be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the arrow. If *I* turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction opposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other source of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled, as well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through the cell. This will tell us the potential difference, *V = V(P) – V(N) = ε – Ir* [Eq. (3.38) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; *I* here is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling the current *I* through the cell one goes from P to N, then of course

$$ V = \epsilon + Ir \quad (3.60) $$

Having clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:
(a) Junction rule: At any junction, the sum of the currents entering the junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction (Fig. 3.15).
n ---------------------------- 

# Page Number: 104
# Physics

This applies equally well if instead of a junction of several lines, we consider a point in a line. The proof of this rule follows from the fact that when currents are steady, there is no accumulation of charges at any junction or at any point in a line. Thus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rate at which charge flows into the junction), must equal the total current flowing out.

(b) **Loop rule:** The algebraic sum of changes in potential around any closed loop involving resistors and cells in the loop is zero (Fig. 3.15).

This rule is also obvious, since electric potential is dependent on the location of the point. Thus starting with any point if we come back to the same point, the total change must be zero. In a closed loop, we do come back to the starting point and hence the rule.

FIGURE 3.15 At junction a the current leaving is *I*₁ + *I*₂ and current entering is *I*₃. The junction rule says *I*₃ = *I*₁ + *I*₂. At point h current entering is *I*₁. There is only one current leaving h and by junction rule that will also be *I*₁. For the loops 'ahdcba' and 'ahdefga', the loop rules give -30*I*₁ - 41 *I*₃ + 45 = 0 and −30*I*₁ + 21 *I*₂ – 80 = 0.

### Example 3.5

A battery of 10 V and negligible internal resistance is connected across the diagonally opposite corners of a cubical network consisting of 12 resistors each of resistance 1 Ω (Fig. 3.16). Determine the equivalent resistance of the network and the current along each edge of the cube.

FIGURE 3.16

# Page Number: 105
## Current Electricity

### Solution

The network is not reducible to a simple series and parallel combinations of resistors. There is, however, a clear symmetry in the problem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of the network.

The paths AA', AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the network. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, *I*. Further, at the corners A', B and D, the incoming current *I* must split equally into the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all the 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of *I*, using Kirchhoff's first rule and the symmetry in the problem.
Next take a closed loop, say, ABCC'EA, and apply Kirchhoff's second rule:
-*IR* - (1/2)*IR* – *IR* + *ε* = 0
where *R* is the resistance of each edge and *ε* the emf of battery. Thus,
*ε* = (5/2)*IR*

The equivalent resistance *R_eq* of the network is
*R_eq* = *ε* / (3*I*) = (5/6)*R*

For *R* = 1 Ω, *R_eq* = (5/6) Ω and for *ε* = 10 V, the total current (= 3*I*) in the network is
3*I* = 10 V/(5/6) Ω = 12 A, i.e., *I* = 4 A
The current flowing in each edge can now be read off from the Fig. 3.16.

It should be noted that because of the symmetry of the network, the great power of Kirchhoff's rules has not been very apparent in Example 3.5. In a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry, and only by application of Kirchhoff's rules to junctions and closed loops (as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can we handle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.6.

### Example 3.6

### Solution
Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current to be determined by the application of Kirchhoff's rules. To reduce the number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is used at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch. We then have three unknowns *I₁*, *I₂* and *I₃* which can be found by applying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops. Kirchhoff's second rule for the closed loop ADCA gives,
10 – 4(*I₁*– *I₂*) + 2(*I₂* + *I₃* – *I₁*) – *I₁* = 0 [3.61(a)]
that is, 7*I₁*-6*I₂* – 2*I₃* = 10
For the closed loop ABCA, we get
10 – 4*I₂*-2 (*I₂* + *I₃*) – *I₁* = 0 [3.61(b)]
that is, *I₁* + 6*I₂* + 2*I₃* =10
For the closed loop BCDEB, we get
5 – 2 (*I₂* + *I₃*) – 2 (*I₂* + *I₃* – *I₁*) = 0 [3.61(c)]
that is, 2*I₁* - 4*I₂* – 4*I₃* = −5
Equations (3.61 a, b, c) are three simultaneous equations in three unknowns. These can be solved by the usual method to give

*I₁* = 2.5A, *I₂* = ⁵⁄₈ A, *I₃* = ⁷⁄₈ A

The currents in the various branches of the network are
*   AB: ⁵⁄₈ A
*   CA: 2 ¹⁄₂ A
*   DEB : 1 ⁷⁄₈ A
*   AD: 1 ⁷⁄₈ A
*   CD: 0 A
*   BC: 2 ¹⁄₂ A

It is easily verified that Kirchhoff's second rule applied to the remaining closed loops does not provide any additional independent equation, that is, the above values of currents satisfy the second rule for every closed loop of the network. For example, the total voltage drop over the closed loop BADEB

5V + ⁵⁄₈ x 4 V - ¹⁵⁄₈ x 4 V

equal to zero, as required by Kirchhoff's second rule.

## 3.13 WHEATSTONE BRIDGE

As an application of Kirchhoff's rules consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.18, which is called the **Wheatstone bridge**. The bridge has four resistors *R₁*, *R₂*, *R₃* and *R₄*. Across one pair of diagonally opposite points (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (*i.e.*, AC) is called the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a galvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This line, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm.
For simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In general there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a current *I<sub>g</sub>* through G. Of special interest, is the case of a **balanced bridge** where the resistors are such that *I<sub>g</sub>* = 0. We can easily get the balance condition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the Kirchhoff's junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure)

### 1.1 INTRODUCTION
All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when we take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather. Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the sky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated due to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we are going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything that does not move or change with time. *Electrostatics* deals with *the study of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges.*

### 1.2 ELECTRIC CHARGE
Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece, around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word

*elektron* meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which
on rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of
papers.

It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth
are brought close to each other, they repel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The
two strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were
rubbed, also repel each other. However, the glass rod and wool attracted
each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat's fur repelled each
other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other hand, the plastic
rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with
which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.

These seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts
and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many
careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of
**electric charge**. We say that the bodies like
glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire
an electric charge on rubbing. There are two kinds of electrification and
we find that (i) **like charges repel** and (ii) **unlike charges attract** each
other. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called
the *polarity* of charge.

When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of
charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for
any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified
glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they
no longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light
objects as they did on being electrified.

Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged
bodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these
observations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects
neutralise or nullify each other's effect. Therefore, the charges were named
as **positive** and **negative** by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.
By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat's fur is called positive and
that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an
electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge
it is said to be electrically neutral.

like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the ground as both are conductors of electricity. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging.

## 1.4 BASIC PROPERTIES OF ELECTRIC CHARGE

We have seen that there are two types of charges, namely positive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each other. Here, we shall now describe some other properties of the electric charge.

If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the distances between them, we treat them as *point charges*. All the charge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point in space.

### 1.4.1 Additivity of charges

We have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall follow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges q₁ and q₂, the total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically q₁ and q₂, i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q₁, q₂, q₃, ..., qₙ, then the total charge of the system is q₁ + q₂ + q₃ + ... + qₙ. Charge has magnitude but no direction, similar to mass. However, there is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, -3, +4 and -5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (-3) + (+4) + (-5) = −1 in the same unit.

### 1.4.2 Charge is conserved

We have already hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by rubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new charges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses. Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is found that the *total charge of the isolated system is always conserved*. Conservation of charge has been established experimentally.

It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed

in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns into a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after the creation.

### 1.4.3 Quantisation of charge

Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples of a basic unit of charge denoted by *e*. Thus charge *q* on a body is always given by

*q* = *ne*

where *n* is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is the charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge on an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is written as -*e* and that on a proton as +*e*.

The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of *e* is termed as *quantisation of charge*. There are a large number of situations in physics where certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by English experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by Millikan in 1912.

In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a *coulomb* and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a subsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge flowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1 of Class XI, Physics Textbook, Part I). In this system, the value of the basic unit of charge is

*e* = 1.602192 × 10⁻¹⁹ C

Thus, there are about 6 × 10¹⁸ electrons in a charge of -1C. In electrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered and hence we use smaller units 1 µC (micro coulomb) = 10⁻⁶ C or 1 mC (milli coulomb) = 10⁻³ C.

If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of *e*. Thus, if a body contains *n₁* electrons and *n₂* protons, the total amount of charge on the body is *n₂* × *e* + *n₁* × (-*e*) = (*n₂* – *n₁*) *e*. Since *n₁* and *n₂* are integers, their difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always an integral multiple of *e* and can be increased or decreased also in steps of *e*.

The step size *e* is, however, very small because at the macroscopic level, we deal with charges of a few µC. At this scale the fact that charge of a body can increase or decrease in units of *e* is not visible. In this respect, the grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.

This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points and lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to us but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to

each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.

At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous compared to the magnitude of charge *e*. Since *e* = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C, a charge of magnitude, say 1 µC, contains something like 10¹³ times the electronic charge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in units of *e* is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous values. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no practical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic level, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds of *e*, i.e., they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale involved that is very important.

### Example 1.1
If 10⁹ electrons move out of a body to another body every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C on the other body?

**Solution** In one second 10⁹ electrons move out of the body. Therefore the charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ × 10⁹ C = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁰ C.
The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated to be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁰ C/s) = 6.25 × 10⁹ s = 6.25 × 10⁹ ÷ (365 × 24 × 3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb, from a body from which 10⁹ electrons move out every second, we will need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large unit for many practical purposes.
It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material. A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 10²⁴ electrons.

### Example 1.2
How much positive and negative charge is there in a cup of water?

**Solution** Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is 250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole (= 6.02 × 10²³ molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of molecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 10²³.
Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to (250/18) × 6.02 × 10²³ × 10 × 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C = 1.34 × 10⁷ C.

## 1.5 COULOMB’S LAW

Coulomb's law is a quantitative statement about the force between two point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the charged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the force between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as the square of the distance between the charges and was directly proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and

*acted* along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two point charges q₁, q₂ are separated by a distance r in vacuum, the magnitude of the force (**F**) between them is given by

F =k
|q₁ q₂|
r²
(1.1)

How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?
Coulomb used a torsion balance* for measuring the force between two charged metallic spheres. When the separation between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges. However, the charges on the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?
Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4, etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and measured the force for different separations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for different pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).

Coulomb's law, a simple mathematical statement, was initially experimentally arrived at in the manner described above. While the original experiments established it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been established down to subatomic level (r ~ 10⁻¹⁰ m).

Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the **explicit** magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round: Coulomb's law can **now** be employed to furnish a definition for a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so far arbitrary. We can choose any positive value of k. The choice of k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the value of k is about 9 × 10⁹ Nm²/C². The unit of charge that results from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined earlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we see that for q₁ = q₂ = 1 C, r = 1 m

F = 9 × 10⁹ N

That is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance of 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in *vacuum* experiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude

### Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736 – 1806)

Coulomb, a French physicist, began his career as a military engineer in the West Indies. In 1776, he returned to Paris and retired to a small estate to do his scientific research. He invented a torsion balance to measure the quantity of a force and used it for determination of forces of electric attraction or repulsion between small charged spheres. He thus arrived in 1785 at the inverse square law relation, now known as Coulomb's law. The law had been anticipated by Priestley and also by Cavendish earlier, though Cavendish never published his results. Coulomb also found the inverse square law of force between unlike and like magnetic poles.

CHARLES AUGUSTIN DE COULOMB (1736–1806)

-   \* A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later by Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects, to verify Newton's Law of Gravitation.
-   \* Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation: two charges (q/2 each) add up to make a total charge q.

9 × 10⁹ N. One coulomb is evidently too big a unit to be used. In practice, in electrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 µC.

The constant *k* in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as *k* = 1/4πε₀ for later convenience, so that Coulomb's law is written as

F = `1 / 4πε₀` `|q₁q₂| / r²` (1.2)

ε₀ is called the *permittivity of free space*. The value of ε₀ in SI units is
ε₀ = 8.854 × 10⁻¹² C² N⁻¹m⁻²

Since force is a vector, it is better to write Coulomb's law in the vector notation. Let the position vectors of charges `q₁` and `q₂` be **r₁** and **r₂** respectively [see Fig.1.3(a)]. We denote force on `q₁` due to `q₂` by **F₁₂** and force on `q₂` due to `q₁` by **F₂₁**. The two point charges `q₁` and `q₂` have been numbered 1 and 2 for convenience and the vector leading from 1 to 2 is denoted by **r₂₁**:
**r₂₁** = **r₂** - **r₁**

In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to 1 is denoted by **r₁₂**:
**r₁₂** = **r₁** - **r₂** = -**r₂₁**

The magnitude of the vectors **r₂₁** and **r₁₂** is denoted by *r₂₁* and *r₁₂*, respectively (*r₁₂* = *r₂₁*). The direction of a vector is specified by a unit vector along the vector. To denote the direction from 1 to 2 (or from 2 to 1), we define the unit vectors:
r̂₂₁ = **r₂₁** / *r₂₁*, r̂₁₂ = **r₁₂** / *r₁₂*, r̂₂₁ = -r̂₁₂

Coulomb's force law between two point charges `q₁` and `q₂` located at **r₁** and **r₂**, respectively is then expressed as

**F₂₁** = `1 / 4πε₀` `q₁q₂ / r₂₁²` r̂₂₁ (1.3)

Some remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant:
*   Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of `q₁` and `q₂` whether positive or negative. If `q₁` and `q₂` are of the same sign (either both positive or both negative), **F₂₁** is along r̂₂₁, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for like charges. If `q₁` and `q₂` are of opposite signs, **F₂₁** is along -r̂₂₁ (= r̂₁₂), which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike charges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.3(b)].

*   The force **F**$_{12}$ on charge *q*₁ due to charge *q*₂, is obtained from Eq. (1.3), by simply interchanging 1 and 2, i.e.,
    $$ \mathbf{F}_{12} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12} = -\mathbf{F}_{21} $$
    Thus, Coulomb's law agrees with the Newton's third law.
*   Coulomb's law [Eq. (1.3)] gives the force between two charges *q*₁ and *q*₂ in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening space has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence of charged constituents of matter. We shall consider electrostatics in matter in the next chapter.

### Example 1.3

Coulomb's law for electrostatic force between two point charges and Newton's law for gravitational force between two stationary point masses, both have inverse-square dependence on the distance between the charges and masses respectively. (a) Compare the strength of these forces by determining the ratio of their magnitudes (i) for an electron and a proton and (ii) for two protons. (b) Estimate the mutual attraction when they are 1 Å (= 10$^{-10}$ m) apart? (*m*$_{p}$ = 1.67 × 10$^{-27}$ kg, *m*$_{e}$ = 9.11 × 10$^{-31}$ kg)

**Solution**

(a) (i) The electric force between an electron and a proton at a distance *r* apart is:
$$ F_e = -\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{r^2} $$
where the negative sign indicates that the force is attractive. The corresponding gravitational force (always attractive) is:
$$ F_G = -G\frac{m_p m_e}{r^2} $$
where *m*$_{p}$ and *m*$_{e}$ are the masses of a proton and an electron respectively.
$$ \left|\frac{F_e}{F_G}\right| = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 G m_p m_e} = 2.4 \times 10^{39} $$

(ii) On similar lines, the ratio of the magnitudes of electric force to the gravitational force between two protons at a distance *r* apart is:
$$ \left|\frac{F_e}{F_G}\right| = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 G m_p m_p} = 1.3 \times 10^{36} $$
However, it may be mentioned here that the signs of the two forces are different. For two protons, the gravitational force is attractive in nature and the Coulomb force is repulsive. The actual values of these forces between two protons inside a nucleus (distance between two protons is ~ 10$^{-15}$ m inside a nucleus) are *F*$_{e}$ ~ 230 N, whereas, *F*$_{G}$ ~ 1.9 × 10$^{-34}$ N.
The (dimensionless) ratio of the two forces shows that electrical forces are enormously stronger than the gravitational forces.

## EXAMPLE 1.3

(b) The electric force **F** exerted by a proton on an electron is same in magnitude to the force exerted by an electron on a proton; however, the masses of an electron and a proton are different. Thus, the magnitude of force is

|**F**| = 1/(4πε₀ r²) e²
= 8.987 × 10⁹ Nm²/C² × (1.6 ×10⁻¹⁹C)² / (10⁻¹⁰m)²
= 2.3 × 10⁻⁸ N

Using Newton's second law of motion, **F** = *ma*, the acceleration that an electron will undergo is
*a* = 2.3×10⁻⁸ N / 9.11 ×10⁻³¹ kg = 2.5 × 10²² m/s²
Comparing this with the value of acceleration due to gravity, we can conclude that the effect of gravitational field is negligible on the motion of electron and it undergoes very large accelerations under the action of Coulomb force due to a proton.

The value for acceleration of the proton is
2.3 × 10⁻⁸ N / 1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg = 1.4 × 10¹⁹ m/s²

In the same way, the force on q₁ due to q₃, denoted by **F₁₃**, is given by

**F₁₃** = 1/(4πε₀) * q₁q₃/r₁₃² **r̂₁₃**

which again is the Coulomb force on q₁ due to q₃, even though other charge q₂ is present.

Thus the total force **F₁** on q₁ due to the two charges q₂ and q₃ is given as

**F₁** = **F₁₂** + **F₁₃** = 1/(4πε₀) * q₁q₂/r₁₂² **r̂₁₂** + 1/(4πε₀) * q₁q₃/r₁₃² **r̂₁₃** (1.4)

The above calculation of force can be generalised to a system of charges more than three, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b).

The principle of superposition says that in a system of charges q₁, q₂, ..., qn, the force on q₁ due to q₂ is the same as given by Coulomb’s law, i.e., it is unaffected by the presence of the other charges q₃, q₄, ..., qn. The total force **F₁** on the charge q₁, due to all other charges, is then given by the vector sum of the forces **F₁₂**, **F₁₃**, ..., **F₁n**.

i.e.,

**F₁** = **F₁₂** + **F₁₃** + ... + **F₁n** = 1/(4πε₀) * q₁q₂/r₁₂² **r̂₁₂** + 1/(4πε₀) * q₁q₃/r₁₃² **r̂₁₃** + ... + 1/(4πε₀) * q₁qn/r₁n² **r̂₁n**
= q₁/(4πε₀) Σ(from i=2 to n) qᵢ/r₁ᵢ² **r̂₁ᵢ** (1.5)

The vector sum is obtained as usual by the parallelogram law of addition of vectors. All of electrostatics is basically a consequence of Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.

### Example 1.5
Consider three charges q₁, q₂, q₃ each equal to q at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side *l*. What is the force on a charge *Q* (with the same sign as q) placed at the centroid of the triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.6?

**Solution** In the given equilateral triangle ABC of sides of length *l*, if we draw a perpendicular AD to the side BC,
AD = AC cos 30° = (√3/2)*l* and the distance AO of the centroid O from A is (2/3) AD = (1/√3)*l*. By symmetry AO = BO = CO.

Thus,
Force **F₁** on *Q* due to charge *q* at A = $\frac{3 Qq}{4\pi\epsilon_0 l^2}$ along AO
Force **F₂** on *Q* due to charge *q* at B = $\frac{3 Qq}{4\pi\epsilon_0 l^2}$ along BO
Force **F₃** on *Q* due to charge *q* at C = $\frac{3 Qq}{4\pi\epsilon_0 l^2}$ along CO

The resultant of forces **F₂** and **F₃** is $\frac{3 Qq}{4\pi\epsilon_0 l^2}$ along OA, by the parallelogram law. Therefore, the total force on *Q* = $\frac{3 Qq}{4\pi\epsilon_0 l^2}$ (**r̂** - **r̂**)
= 0, where **r̂** is the unit vector along OA.
It is clear also by symmetry that the three forces will sum to zero.
Suppose that the resultant force was non-zero but in some direction.
Consider what would happen if the system was rotated through 60° about O.

**FIGURE 1.7**

#### Solution
The forces acting on charge *q* at A due to charges *q* at B and -*q* at C are **F₁₂** along BA and **F₁₃** along AC respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.7. By the parallelogram law, the total force **F₁** on the charge *q* at A is given by
**F₁** = *F* **r̂₁**, where **r̂₁** is a unit vector along BC.
The force of attraction or repulsion for each pair of charges has the same magnitude *F* = $\frac{q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 l^2}$

The total force **F₂** on charge *q* at B is thus **F₂** = *F* **r̂₂** where **r̂₂** is a unit vector along AC.

## EXAMPLE 1.6
Similarly the total force on charge –q at C is `F_3 = √3 F **n**^`, where `**n**^` is the unit vector along the direction bisecting the ∠BCA.
It is interesting to see that the sum of the forces on the three charges is zero, i.e.,
`**F**_1 + **F**_2 + **F**_3 = 0`
The result is not at all surprising. It follows straight from the fact that Coulomb's law is consistent with Newton's third law. The proof is left to you as an exercise.

## 1.7 ELECTRIC FIELD
Let us consider a point charge **Q** placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we place another point charge q at a point P, where **OP** = **r**, then the charge **Q** will exert a force on q as per Coulomb's law. We may ask the question: If charge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there nothing? If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act when we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the early scientists introduced the concept of *field*. According to this, we say that the charge **Q** produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding. When another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on it and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge **Q** at a point **r** is given as
`**E**(**r**) = (1/(4πε₀)) (**Q**/r²) **r**^ = (1/(4πε₀)) (**Q**/r²) **r**^` (1.6)

where `**r**^` = **r**/r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point **r**. Thus, Eq.(1.6) specifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position vector **r**. The word “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which could be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge has been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. We obtain the force **F** exerted by a charge **Q** on a charge **q**, as
`**F** = (1/(4πε₀)) (Qq/r²) **r**^` (1.7)

Note that the charge **q** also exerts an equal and opposite force on the charge **Q**. The electrostatic force between the charges **Q** and **q** can be looked upon as an interaction between charge **q** and the electric field of **Q** and *vice versa*. If we denote the position of charge **q** by the vector **r**, it experiences a force **F** equal to the charge **q** multiplied by the electric field **E** at the location of **q**. Thus,
`**F**(**r**) = **qE**(**r**)` (1.8)

Equation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C\*.
Some important remarks may be made here:
(i) From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if **q** is unity, the electric field due to a charge **Q** is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the electric field due to a charge **Q** at a point in space may be defined as the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed

## Electric Charges and Fields

at that point. The charge **Q**, which is producing the electric field, is called a *source charge* and the charge **q**, which tests the effect of a *source charge*, is called a *test charge*. Note that the *source charge* **Q** must remain at its original location. However, if a charge **q** is brought at any point around **Q**, **Q** itself is bound to experience an electrical force due to **q** and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to make **q** negligibly small. The force **F** is then negligibly small but the ratio **F**/**q** is finite and defines the electric field:

```
E = lim  F
    q→0  q
```
(1.9)

A practical way to get around the problem (of keeping **Q** undisturbed in the presence of **q**) is to hold **Q** to its location by unspecified forces! This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice. When we are considering the electric force on a *test charge* **q** due to a charged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to their locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents inside the sheet.

1.  Note that the electric field **E** due to **Q**, though defined operationally in terms of some *test charge* **q**, is independent of **q**. This is because **F** is proportional to **q**, so the ratio **F**/**q** does not depend on **q**. The force **F** on the charge **q** due to the charge **Q** depends on the particular location of charge **q** which may take any value in the space around the charge **Q**. Thus, the electric field **E** due to **Q** is also dependent on the space coordinate **r**. For different positions of the charge **q** all over the space, we get different values of electric field **E**. The field exists at every point in three-dimensional space.
2.  For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially outwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the *source charge* is negative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards.
3.  Since the magnitude of the force **F** on charge **q** due to charge **Q** depends only on the distance **r** of the charge **q** from charge **Q**, the magnitude of the electric field **E** will also depend only on the distance **r**. Thus at equal distances from the charge **Q**, the magnitude of its electric field **E** is same. The magnitude of electric field **E** due to a point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its centre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.

### 1.7.1 Electric field due to a system of charges

Consider a system of charges **q**₁, **q**₂, ..., **q**ₙ with position vectors **r**₁, **r**₂, ... **r**ₙ relative to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in space due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the system of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit *test charge* placed at that point, without disturbing the original positions of charges **q**₁, **q**₂, ..., **q**ₙ. We can use Coulomb's law and the superposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by position vector **r**.

Electric field **E₁** at **r** due to *q₁* at **r₁** is given by
E₁ = $\frac{1}{4πε₀} \frac{q_1}{r_{1P}^2} \hat{r}_{1P}$

where $\hat{r}_{1P}$ is a unit vector in the direction from *q₁* to P, and *r₁P* is the distance between *q₁* and P.
In the same manner, electric field **E₂** at **r** due to *q₂* at **r₂** is
E₂ = $\frac{1}{4πε₀} \frac{q_2}{r_{2P}^2} \hat{r}_{2P}$

where $\hat{r}_{2P}$ is a unit vector in the direction from *q₂* to P and *r₂P* is the distance between *q₂* and P. Similar expressions hold good for fields **E₃**, **E₄**, ..., **E_n** due to charges *q₃*, *q₄*, ..., *q_n*.
By the superposition principle, the electric field **E** at **r** due to the system of charges is (as shown in Fig. 1.9)
E(r) = **E₁** (r) + **E₂** (r) + ... + **E_n** (r)
= $\frac{1}{4πε₀} \frac{q_1}{r_{1P}^2} \hat{r}_{1P} + \frac{1}{4πε₀} \frac{q_2}{r_{2P}^2} \hat{r}_{2P} + ... + \frac{1}{4πε₀} \frac{q_n}{r_{nP}^2} \hat{r}_{nP}$
E(r) = $\frac{1}{4πε₀} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{q_i}{r_{iP}^2} \hat{r}_{iP}$ (1.10)

**E** is a vector quantity that varies from one point to another point in space and is determined from the positions of the source charges.

### 1.7.2 Physical significance of electric field

You may wonder why the notion of electric field has been introduced here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb's law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this intermediate quantity called the electric field?

For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing the system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine the field. The term *field* in physics generally refers to a quantity that is defined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric field is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.

The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however, emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force between two distant charges *q₁*, *q₂* in accelerated motion. Now the greatest speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another is *c*, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of *q₁* on *q₂* cannot

arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect (force on q₂) and the cause (motion of q₁). It is precisely here that the notion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very useful. *The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q₁ produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed c, reach q₂ and cause a force on q₂.* The notion of field elegantly accounts for the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be detected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an *independent dynamics* of their own, i.e., they evolve according to laws of their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time and then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields transporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday and is now among the central concepts in physics.

### Example 1.7
An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a uniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 10⁴ N C⁻¹ [Fig. 1.10(a)]. The direction of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged and a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.10(b)]. Compute the time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free fall under gravity’.

FIGURE 1.10

**Solution** In Fig. 1.10(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged electron experiences a downward force of magnitude *eE* where *E* is the magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is
*a_e* = *eE*/*m_e*
where *m_e* is the mass of the electron.

Starting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a distance *h* is given by
*t_e* = sqrt(2*h*/*a_e*) = sqrt(2*h* *m_e* / (*eE*))

For *e* = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C, *m_e* = 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg,
*E* = 2.0 × 10⁴ N C⁻¹, *h* = 1.5 × 10⁻² m,
*t_e* = 2.9 × 10⁻⁹ s

In Fig. 1.10 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged proton experiences a downward force of magnitude *eE*. The acceleration of the proton is
*a_p* = *eE*/*m_p*
where *m_p* is the mass of the proton; *m_p* = 1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg. The time of fall for the proton is

**EXAMPLE 1.7**
$t_p = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{a_p}} = \sqrt{\frac{2hm_p}{eE}} = 1.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{s}$

Thus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through the same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of 'free fall under gravity' where the time of fall is independent of the mass of the body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration due to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified, let us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric field:

$a_p = \frac{eE}{m_p}$
$= \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}) \times (2.0 \times 10^4 \text{ NC}^{-1})}{1.67 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}}$
$= 1.9 \times 10^{12} \text{ ms}^{-2}$

which is enormous compared to the value of *g* (9.8 m s⁻²), the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even greater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored in this example.

### Example 1.8
Two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$, of magnitude +10⁻⁸ C and -10⁻⁸ C, respectively, are placed 0.1 m apart. Calculate the electric fields at points A, B and C shown in Fig. 1.11.

FIGURE 1.11

#### Solution
The electric field vector **E₁A** at A due to the positive charge $q_1$ points towards the right and has a magnitude
$E_{1A} = \frac{(9 \times 10^9 \text{Nm}^2\text{C}^{-2}) \times (10^{-8}\text{C})}{(0.05 \text{m})^2} = 3.6 \times 10^4 \text{ NC}^{-1}$

The electric field vector **E₂A** at A due to the negative charge $q_2$ points towards the right and has the same magnitude. Hence the magnitude of the total electric field $E_A$ at A is
$E_A = E_{1A} + E_{2A} = 7.2 \times 10^4 \text{ N C}^{-1}$
**E_A** is directed toward the right.

FIGURE 1.13 Dependence of electric field strength on the distance and its relation to the number of field lines.

It is the relative density of lines in different regions which is important.
We draw the figure on the plane of paper, *i.e.*, in two-dimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes to estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the number of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular to the lines. Since the electric field decreases as the square of the distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the charge increases as the square of the distance, the number of field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant, whatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.

We started by saying that the field lines carry information about the direction of electric field at different points in space. Having drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density (*i.e.*, closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates the relative strength of electric field at those points. The field lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart where it is weak. Figure 1.13 shows a set of field lines. We can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and S normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at these points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.

To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather the *solid angle* subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the area with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions. Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small transverse line element `Δl` be placed at a distance *r* from a point O. Then the angle subtended by `Δl` at O can be approximated as `Δθ = Δl/r`.

Likewise, in three-dimensions the *solid angle*** subtended by a small perpendicular plane area `ΔS`, at a distance *r*, can be written as `ΔΩ = ΔS/r^2`. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial field lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points `P_1` and `P_2` at distances `r_1` and `r_2` from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle `ΔΩ` is `r_1^2 ΔΩ` at `P_1`, and an element of area `r_2^2 ΔΩ` at `P_2`, respectively. The number of lines (say *n*) cutting these area elements are the same. The number of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore `n/(r_1^2 ΔΩ)` at `P_1` and `n/(r_2^2 ΔΩ)` at `P_2`, respectively. Since *n* and `ΔΩ` are common, the strength of the field clearly has a `1/r^2` dependence.

The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an intuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around charged configurations. Faraday called them *lines of force*. This term is *somewhat misleading*, especially in case of *magnetic fields*. The more appropriate term is *field lines* (electric or magnetic) that we have adopted in this book.

Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric field around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,

*   Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone with a sphere of radius *R*. The solid angle `ΔΩ` of the cone is defined to be equal to `ΔS/R^2`, where `ΔS` is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.

a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each point is in the direction of the net field at that point. An arrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the direction of electric field from the two possible directions indicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space curve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.
Figure 1.14 shows the field lines around some simple charge configurations. As mentioned earlier, the field lines are in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them only in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge are radially outward while those of a single negative charge are radially inward. The field lines around a system of two positive charges (*q*, *q*) give a vivid pictorial description of their mutual repulsion, while those around the configuration of two equal and opposite charges (*q*, -*q*), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction between the charges. The field lines follow some important general properties:
(i) Field lines start from positive charges and end at negative charges. If there is a single charge, they may start or end at infinity.
(ii) In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken to be continuous curves without any breaks.
(iii) Two field lines can never cross each other. (If they did, the field at the point of intersection will not have a unique direction, which is absurd.)
(iv) Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops. This follows from the conservative nature of electric field (Chapter 2).

### 1.9 ELECTRIC FLUX

Consider flow of a liquid with velocity **v**, through a small flat surface d*S*, in a direction normal to the surface. The rate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the area per unit time *v*d*S* and represents the flux of liquid flowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is not parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to **v**, but makes an angle θ with it, the projected area in a plane perpendicular to **v** is δd*S* cos θ. Therefore, the flux going out of the surface d*S* is **v** · **n** d*S*. For the case of the electric field, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric flux. We should, however, note that there is no flow of a physically observable quantity unlike the case of liquid flow.

In the picture of electric field lines described above, we saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area, placed normal to the field at a point is a measure of the strength of electric field at that point. This means that if

## Physics

we place a small planar element of area Δ*S* normal to **E** at a point, the number of field lines crossing it is proportional\* to *E* Δ*S*. Now suppose we tilt the area element by angle θ. Clearly, the number of field lines crossing the area element will be smaller. The projection of the area element normal to **E** is Δ*S* cosθ. Thus, the number of field lines crossing Δ*S* is proportional to *E* Δ*S* cosθ. When θ = 90°, field lines will be parallel to Δ*S* and will not cross it at all (Fig. 1.15).

The orientation of area element and not merely its magnitude is important in many contexts. For example, in a stream, the amount of water flowing through a ring will naturally depend on how you hold the ring. If you hold it normal to the flow, maximum water will flow through it than if you hold it with some other orientation. This shows that an area element should be treated as a vector. It has a magnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar area? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the plane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.

How to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine dividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements. Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated with it, as explained before.

Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along its normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do we choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element? This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given context. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple. The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken to be in the direction of the *outward* normal. This is the convention used in Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector Δ**S** at a point on a closed surface equals Δ*S* **n̂** where Δ*S* is the magnitude of the area element and **n̂** is a unit vector in the direction of *outward* normal at that point.

We now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux ΔΦ through an area element Δ**S** is defined by
ΔΦ = **E**•Δ**S** = *E*Δ*S* cosθ (1.11)

which, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting the area element. The angle θ here is the angle between **E** and Δ**S**. For a closed surface, with the convention stated already, θ is the angle between **E** and the *outward* normal to the area element. Notice we could look at the expression *E* Δ*S* cosθ in two ways: *E* (Δ*S* cosθ) i.e., *E* times the

\* It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to *E*Δ*S*. The number of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to draw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing a given area at different points.

projection of area normal to **E**, or *E*<sub>⊥</sub> ΔS, i.e., component of **E** along the normal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The unit of electric flux is N C⁻¹ m².

The basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in principle, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we have to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the flux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux φ through a surface S is

Φ ≈ Σ **E**⋅Δ**S**
(1.12)

The approximation sign is put because the electric field **E** is taken to be constant over the small area element. This is mathematically exact only when you take the limit ΔS → 0 and the sum in Eq. (1.12) is written as an integral.

## 1.10 ELECTRIC DIPOLE

An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite point charges *q* and -*q*, separated by a distance 2*a*. The line connecting the two charges defines a direction in space. By convention, the direction from –*q* to *q* is said to be the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of -*q* and *q* is called the centre of the dipole.

The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not mean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge *q* and -*q* are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when added, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than the separation of the two charges forming a dipole (*r* >> 2*a*), the fields due to *q* and -*q* nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole therefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/*r*² (the dependence on *r* of the field due to a single charge *q*). These qualitative ideas are borne out by the explicit calculation as follows:

### 1.10.1 The field of an electric dipole

The electric field of the pair of charges (–*q* and *q*) at any point in space can be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle. The results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on the dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the *equatorial plane* of the dipole, i.e., on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre. The electric field at any general point P is obtained by adding the electric fields **E**<sub>–*q*</sub> due to the charge –*q* and **E**<sub>+*q*</sub> due to the charge *q*, by the parallelogram law of vectors.

#### (i) For points on the axis

Let the point P be at distance *r* from the centre of the dipole on the side of the charge *q*, as shown in Fig. 1.17(a). Then

**E**<sub>–*q*</sub> = -q / (4πε₀(*r* + *a*)²) **p**
[1.13(a)]

where **p** is the unit vector along the dipole axis (from -*q* to *q*). Also

**E**<sub>+*q*</sub> = q / (4πε₀(*r* - *a*)²) **p**
[1.13(b)]

The total field at P is
$\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_{+q} + \mathbf{E}_{-q} = \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left( \frac{1}{(r-a)^2} - \frac{1}{(r+a)^2} \right) \mathbf{p}$
$= \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{4ar}{(r^2-a^2)^2} \mathbf{p}$ (1.14)

For $r >> a$
$\mathbf{E} = \frac{4qa}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^3} \mathbf{p}$ ($r>>a$) (1.15)

### (ii) For points on the equatorial plane

The magnitudes of the electric fields due to the two charges $+q$ and $-q$ are given by
$E_{+q} = \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{1}{r^2+a^2}$ [1.16(a)]
$E_{-q} = \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{1}{r^2+a^2}$ [1.16(b)]
and are equal.

The directions of $\mathbf{E}_{+q}$ and $\mathbf{E}_{-q}$ are as shown in Fig. 1.17(b). Clearly, the components normal to the dipole axis cancel away. The components along the dipole axis add up. The total electric field is opposite to $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$. We have
$\mathbf{E} = - (E_{+q} + E_{-q}) \cos\theta \hat{\mathbf{p}}$
$= -\frac{2qa}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 (r^2+a^2)^{3/2}} \hat{\mathbf{p}}$ (1.17)

At large distances ($r>>a$), this reduces to
$\mathbf{E} = -\frac{2qa}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^3} \hat{\mathbf{p}}$ ($r>>a$) (1.18)

**FIGURE 1.17** Electric field of a dipole at (a) a point on the axis, (b) a point on the equatorial plane of the dipole. $\mathbf{p}$ is the dipole moment vector of magnitude $p = q \times 2a$ and directed from $-q$ to $q$.

From Eqs. (1.15) and (1.18), it is clear that the dipole field at large distances does not involve $q$ and $a$ separately; it depends on the product $qa$. This suggests the definition of dipole moment. The dipole moment vector $\mathbf{p}$ of an electric dipole is defined by
$\mathbf{p} = q \times 2a \hat{\mathbf{p}}$ (1.19)
that is, it is a vector whose magnitude is charge $q$ times the separation $2a$ (between the pair of charges $q$, $-q$) and the direction is along the line from $-q$ to $q$. In terms of $\mathbf{p}$, the electric field of a dipole at large distances takes simple forms:

At a point on the dipole axis
$\mathbf{E} = \frac{2\mathbf{p}}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^3}$ ($r>>a$) (1.20)

At a point on the equatorial plane
$\mathbf{E} = -\frac{\mathbf{p}}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^3}$ ($r>>a$) (1.21)

## Electric Charges and Fields

Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances falls off not as 1/r² but as 1/r³. Further, the magnitude and the direction of the dipole field depends not only on the distance *r* but also on the *angle* between the position vector **r** and the dipole moment **p**.

We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2*a* approaches zero, the charge *q* approaches infinity in such a way that the product *p* = *q* × 2*a* is finite. Such a dipole is referred to as a *point dipole*. For a point dipole, Eqs. (1.20) and (1.21) are exact, true for any *r*.

### 1.10.2 Physical significance of dipoles

In most molecules, the centres of positive charges and of negative charges\* lie at the same place. Therefore, their dipole moment is zero. CO₂ and CH₄ are of this type of molecules. However, they develop a dipole moment when an electric field is applied. But in some molecules, the centres of negative charges and of positive charges do not coincide. Therefore they have a permanent electric dipole moment, even in the absence of an electric field. Such molecules are called polar molecules. Water molecules, H₂O, is an example of this type. Various materials give rise to interesting properties and important applications in the presence or absence of electric field.

**Example 1.9** Two charges ±10 µC are placed 5.0 mm apart. Determine the electric field at (a) a point P on the axis of the dipole 15 cm away from its centre O on the side of the positive charge, as shown in Fig. 1.18(a), and (b) a point Q, 15 cm away from O on a line passing through O and normal to the axis of the dipole, as shown in Fig. 1.18(b).

## Solution
(a) Field at P due to charge +10 µC
= (10⁻⁵ C / [4π(8.854 × 10⁻¹² C² N⁻¹ m⁻²)]) × (1 / [(15-0.25)² × 10⁻⁴ m²])
= 4.13 × 10⁶ N C⁻¹ along BP

Field at P due to charge -10 µC
= (10⁻⁵ C / [4π(8.854 × 10⁻¹² C² N⁻¹ m⁻²)]) × (1 / [(15 +0.25)² × 10⁻⁴ m²])
= 3.86 × 10⁶ N C⁻¹ along PA

The resultant electric field at P due to the two charges at A and B is
= 2.7 × 10⁵ N C⁻¹ along BP.

In this example, the ratio OP/OB is quite large (= 60). Thus, we can expect to get approximately the same result as above by directly using the formula for electric field at a far-away point on the axis of a dipole. For a dipole consisting of charges ± q, 2a distance apart, the electric field at a distance r from the centre on the axis of the dipole has a magnitude

E = 2p / (4πε₀r³) (r/a >> 1)

where p = 2a q is the magnitude of the dipole moment. The direction of electric field on the dipole axis is always along the direction of the dipole moment vector (i.e., from -q to q). Here, p = 10⁻⁵ C × 5 × 10⁻³ m = 5×10⁻⁸ C m
Therefore,

E = (2×5×10⁻⁸ Cm / [4π(8.854 ×10⁻¹² C² N⁻¹ m⁻²)]) × (1 / [(15)³ ×10⁻⁶ m³]) = 2.6 × 10⁵ N C⁻¹

along the dipole moment direction AB, which is close to the result obtained earlier.

(b) Field at Q due to charge + 10 µC at B
= 10⁻⁵ C / [4 π (8.854 ×10⁻¹² C² N⁻¹ m⁻²) [15²+(0.25)²] ×10⁻⁴ m²]
= 3.99 × 10⁶ N C⁻¹ along BQ

Field at Q due to charge -10 µC at A
= 10⁻⁵ C / [4 π(8.854 ×10⁻¹² C² N⁻¹ m⁻²) [15² +(0.25)²] ×10⁻⁴ m²]
= 3.99 × 10⁶ N C⁻¹ along QA.

Clearly, the components of these two forces with equal magnitudes cancel along the direction OQ but add up along the direction parallel to BA. Therefore, the resultant electric field at Q due to the two charges at A and B is

= 2 × 0.25 / √[15² + (0.25)²] × 3.99 × 10⁶ N C⁻¹ along BA
= 1.33 × 10⁵ N C⁻¹ along BA.

As in (a), we can expect to get approximately the same result by directly using the formula for dipole field at a point on the normal to the axis of the dipole:

`= 1.33 x 10⁵ NC⁻¹.`
The direction of electric field in this case is opposite to the direction of the dipole moment vector. Again, the result agrees with that obtained before.

## 1.11 DIPOLE IN A UNIFORM EXTERNAL FIELD

Consider a permanent dipole of dipole moment **p** in a uniform external field **E**, as shown in Fig. 1.19. (By permanent dipole, we mean that **p** exists irrespective of **E**; it has not been induced by **E**.)

There is a force *q***E** on *q* and a force -*q***E** on –*q*. The net force on the dipole is zero, since **E** is uniform. However, the charges are separated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque on the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is independent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of each force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular distance between the two antiparallel forces).

Magnitude of torque = *q E* × 2 *a* sinθ
= 2 *q a E* sinθ

Its direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it. The magnitude of **p** × **E** is also *p E* sinθ and its direction is normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,
`τ = p x E` (1.22)

This torque will tend to align the dipole with the field **E**. When **p** is aligned with **E**, the torque is zero.

What happens if the field is not uniform? In that case, the net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there will, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The general case is involved, so let us consider the simpler situations when **p** is parallel to **E** or antiparallel to **E**. In either case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force on the dipole if **E** is not uniform.

Figure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that when **p** is parallel to **E**, the dipole has a net force in the direction of increasing field. When **p** is antiparallel to **E**, the net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing field. In general, the force depends on the orientation of **p** with respect to **E**.

This brings us to a common observation in frictional electricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of paper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through friction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains the attractive force? Taking the clue from the preceding

discussion, the charged comb 'polarises' the piece of paper, i.e., induces a net dipole moment in the direction of field. Further, the electric field due to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a dipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen that the paper should move in the direction of the comb!

## 1.12 CONTINUOUS CHARGE DISTRIBUTION
We have so far dealt with charge configurations involving discrete charges q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ. One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the mathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For many purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete charges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For example, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify the charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged constituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element ΔS (Fig. 1.21) on the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic scale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and specify the charge ΔQ on that element. We then define a *surface charge density* σ at the area element by

$\sigma = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta S}$ (1.23)

We can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at a continuous function σ, called the surface charge density. The surface charge density σ so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the discontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level\*. σ represents macroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out average of the microscopic charge density over an area element ΔS which, as said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The units for σ are C/m².

Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume charge distribution. The *linear charge density* λ of a wire is defined by

$\lambda = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta l}$ (1.24)

where Δl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that, however, includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents, and ΔQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for λ are C/m. The *volume charge density* (sometimes simply called charge density) is defined in a similar manner:

$\rho = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta V}$ (1.25)

where ΔQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume element ΔV that includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents. The units for ρ are C/m³.

The notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we adopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer to

FIGURE 1.21
Definition of linear, surface and volume charge densities.
*   Line charge ΔQ = λ Δl
*   Surface charge ΔQ = σΔS
*   Volume charge ΔQ = ρΔV

In each case, the element (Δl, ΔS, ΔV) chosen is small on the macroscopic scale but contains a very large number of microscopic constituents.

\* At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are discrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.

(1.30)

Equation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of electrostatics called Gauss's law.
We state Gauss's law without proof:
Electric flux through a closed surface S
= q/ε₀
q = total charge enclosed by S.
(1.31)
The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is zero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in the simple situation of Fig. 1.23.
Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed cylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field **E**. The total flux φ through the surface is φ = φ₁ + φ₂ + φ₃, where φ₁ and φ₂ represent the flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the cylinder and φ₃ is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the closed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is perpendicular to **E**, so by definition of flux, φ₃ = 0. Further, the outward normal to 2 is along **E** while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to **E**. Therefore,

φ₁ = −E S₁, φ₂ = +E S₂
S₁ = S₂ = S

where S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero, as expected by Gauss's law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric flux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge contained in the closed surface is zero.
The great significance of Gauss's law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let us note some important points regarding this law:
(i) Gauss's law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape or size.
(ii) The term *q* on the right side of Gauss's law, Eq. (1.31), includes the sum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located anywhere inside the surface.
(iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some charges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears on the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and outside *S*. The term *q* on the right side of Gauss's law, however, represents only the total charge inside *S*.

(iv) The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss's law is called the Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and apply Gauss's law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of any charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without any bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a continuous charge distribution.
(v) Gauss's law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the electrostatic field when *the system has some symmetry*. This is facilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.
(vi) Finally, Gauss's law is based on the inverse square dependence on distance contained in the Coulomb's law. Any violation of Gauss's law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.

### Solution
(a) Since the electric field has only an x component, for faces perpendicular to x direction, the angle between **E** and Δ**S** is ± π/2. Therefore, the flux φ = **E**.Δ**S** is separately zero for each face of the cube except the two shaded ones. Now the magnitude of the electric field at the left face is
E_L = αx¹/² = αa¹/²
(x = a at the left face).
The magnitude of electric field at the right face is
E_R = α x¹/² = α (2a)¹/²
(x = 2a at the right face).
The corresponding fluxes are
φ_L = **E**_L • Δ**S** = ΔS**E**_L • **n**_L = E_L ΔS cosθ = -E_L ΔS, since θ = 180°

(b) We can use Gauss's law to find the total charge *q* inside the cube.
We have φ = *q*/ε₀ or *q* = φε₀. Therefore,
*q* = 1.05 × 8.854 × 10⁻¹² C = 9.27 × 10⁻¹² C.

### Example 1.11

An electric field is uniform, and in the positive *x* direction for positive *x*, and uniform with the same magnitude but in the negative *x* direction for negative *x*. It is given that **E** = 200 **i** N/C for *x* > 0 and **E** = -200 **i** N/C for *x* < 0. A right circular cylinder of length 20 cm and radius 5 cm has its centre at the origin and its axis along the *x*-axis so that one face is at *x* = +10 cm and the other is at *x* = -10 cm (Fig. 1.25). (a) What is the net outward flux through each flat face? (b) What is the flux through the side of the cylinder? (c) What is the net outward flux through the cylinder? (d) What is the net charge inside the cylinder?

Solution

(a) We can see from the figure that on the left face **E** and Δ**S** are parallel. Therefore, the outward flux is
φ_L = **E**·Δ**S** = − 200 **i**·Δ**S**
= + 200 ΔS, since **i**·Δ**S** = − ΔS
= + 200 × π (0.05)² = + 1.57 N m² C⁻¹
On the right face, **E** and Δ**S** are parallel and therefore
φ_R = **E**·Δ**S** = + 1.57 N m² C⁻¹.

(b) For any point on the side of the cylinder **E** is perpendicular to Δ**S** and hence **E**·Δ**S** = 0. Therefore, the flux out of the side of the cylinder is zero.

(c) Net outward flux through the cylinder
φ = 1.57 + 1.57 + 0 = 3.14 N m² C⁻¹

FIGURE 1.25

(d) The net charge within the cylinder can be found by using Gauss's law which gives
*q* = ε₀φ

### Flux through the Gaussian surface
= flux through the curved cylindrical part of the surface
= **E** × 2πrl
The surface includes charge equal to λl. Gauss's law then gives
**E** × 2πrl = λl/ε₀

i.e., **E** = $\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0 r}$

Vectorially, **E** at any point is given by
**E** = $\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0 r}$ **n** (1.32)

where **n** is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing through the point. **E** is directed outward if λ is positive and inward if λ is negative.
Note that when we write a vector **A** as a scalar multiplied by a unit vector, i.e., as **A** = A **â**, the scalar A is an algebraic number. It can be negative or positive. The direction of **A** will be the same as that of the unit vector **â** if A > 0 and opposite to **â** if A < 0. When we want to restrict to non-negative values, we use the symbol |**A**| and call it the modulus of **A**.
Thus, |**A**| ≥ 0.
Also note that though only the charge enclosed by the surface (λl) was included above, the electric field **E** is due to the charge on the entire wire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial. Without this assumption, we cannot take **E** to be normal to the curved part of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq. (1.32) is approximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long wire, where the end effects may be ignored.

### 1.14.2 Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet

Let σ be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet (Fig. 1.27). We take the *x*-axis normal to the given plane. By symmetry, the electric field will not depend on *y* and *z* coordinates and its direction at every point must be parallel to the *x*-direction.

We can take the Gaussian surface to be a rectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area A, as shown. (A cylindrical surface will also do.) As seen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will contribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel to the other faces and they, therefore, do not contribute to the total flux.
The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in -*x* direction while the unit vector normal to surface 2 is in the +*x* direction. Therefore, flux **E**.Δ**S** through both the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore the net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 **E**A. The charge enclosed by the closed surface is σA. Therefore by Gauss's law,

or, E = σ/2ε₀
Vectorically,
**E** = (σ/2ε₀) **n̂** (1.33)

where **n̂** is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it.
**E** is directed away from the plate if σ is positive and toward the plate if σ is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss' law has brought out an additional fact: E is independent of *x* also.
For a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the middle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends.

### 1.14.3 Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell

Let σ be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of radius R (Fig. 1.28). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The field at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on *r* (the radial distance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e., along the radius vector).

**(i) Field outside the shell:** Consider a point P outside the shell with radius vector **r**. To calculate **E** at P, we take the Gaussian surface to be a sphere of radius *r* and with centre O, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent relative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we mean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point of the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude E and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, **E** and Δ**S** at every point are parallel and the flux through each element is E ΔS. Summing over all ΔS, the flux through the Gaussian surface is E × 4 π *r*². The charge enclosed is σ × 4 π R². By Gauss's law

E × 4 π *r*² = (σ/ε₀) 4 π R²
Or, E = (σ R²/ε₀ *r*²) = q/(4πε₀ *r*²)
where q = 4 πR² σ is the total charge on the spherical shell.
Vectorially,
**E** = q/(4πε₀ *r*²) **r̂** (1.34)

The electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward if q < 0. This, however, is exactly the field produced by a charge q placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due to a uniformly charged shell is as if the entire charge of the shell is concentrated at its centre.

**(ii) Field inside the shell:** In Fig. 1.28(b), the point P is inside the shell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.

The flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is
*E* × 4 *πr*². However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no
charge. Gauss's law then gives
*E* × 4 *πr*² = 0
i.e., *E* = 0 (*r* < *R*) (1.35)
that is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points
inside the shell\*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss's
law which follows from Coulomb's law. The experimental verification of
this result confirms the 1/*r*² dependence in Coulomb's law.

## Example 1.12
An early model for an atom considered it to have a
positively charged point nucleus of charge *Ze*, surrounded by a
uniform density of negative charge up to a radius *R*. The atom as a
whole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance
*r* from the nucleus?

![FIGURE 1.29](image_placeholder_for_figure_1.29)
FIGURE 1.29

### Solution
The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as
shown in Fig. 1.29. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical
charge distribution of radius *R* must be -*Z*e, since the atom (nucleus
of charge *Ze* + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us
the negative charge density *ρ*, since we must have
(4/3)*πR*³ *ρ* = 0 - *Ze*
or *ρ* = - 3*Ze* / (4*πR*³)

To find the electric field *E*(*r*) at a point P which is a distance *r* away
from the nucleus, we use Gauss's law. Because of the spherical
symmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric
field *E*(*r*) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the
direction of *r*. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector *r*
from the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a
spherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations,
namely, *r* < *R* and *r* > *R*.

(i) *r* < *R*: The electric flux *φ* enclosed by the spherical surface is
*φ* = *E* (*r*) × 4 *πr*²

## MOVING CHARGES AND MAGNETISM

### 4.1 INTRODUCTION
Both Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000 years. However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was realised that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstration in the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the wire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the current is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the earth's magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the current reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in concentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted concluded that *moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field in the surrounding space*.

Following this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws obeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by

A remarkable scientific and technological progress took place in the 20th century. This was due to our increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of devices for production, amplification, transmission and detection of electromagnetic waves.

(c) The arrangement of iron filings around the wire. The darkened ends of the needle represent north poles. The effect of the earth's magnetic field is neglected.

### Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)
Danish physicist and chemist, professor at Copenhagen. He observed that a compass needle suffers a deflection when placed near a wire carrying an electric current. This discovery gave the first empirical evidence of a connection between electric and magnetic phenomena.

In this chapter, we will see how magnetic field exerts forces on moving charged particles, like electrons, protons, and current-carrying wires. We shall also learn how currents produce magnetic fields. We shall see how particles can be accelerated to very high energies in a cyclotron. We shall study how currents and voltages are detected by a galvanometer.

In this and subsequent Chapter on magnetism, we adopt the following convention: A current or a field (electric or magnetic) emerging out of the plane of the paper is depicted by a dot (O). A current or a field going into the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross (⊗)\*. Figures. 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) correspond to these two situations, respectively.

### 4.2 MAGNETIC FORCE
### 4.2.1 Sources and fields

Before we introduce the concept of a magnetic field **B**, we shall recapitulate what we have learnt in Chapter 1 about the electric field **E**. We have seen that the interaction between two charges can be considered in two stages. The charge *Q*, the source of the field, produces an electric field **E**, where

## Moving Charges and Magnetism

**E** = *Q* **ŕ** / (4πε)² (4.1)

where **ŕ** is unit vector along **r**, and the field **E** is a vector field. A charge *q* interacts with this field and experiences a force **F** given by

**F** = *q***E** =*qQ* **ŕ** / (4πε) *r*² (4.2)

As pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field **E** is not just an artefact but has a physical role. It can convey energy and momentum and is not established instantaneously but takes finite time to propagate. The concept of a field was specially stressed by Faraday and was incorporated by Maxwell in his unification of electricity and magnetism. In addition to depending on each point in space, it can also vary with time, i.e., be a function of time. In our discussions in this chapter, we will assume that the fields do not change with time.

The field at a particular point can be due to one or more charges. If there are more charges the fields add vectorially. You have already learnt in Chapter 1 that this is called the principle of superposition. Once the field is known, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (4.2).

Just as static charges produce an electric field, the currents or moving charges produce (in addition) a magnetic field, denoted by **B** (**r**), again a vector field. It has several basic properties identical to the electric field. It is defined at each point in space (and can in addition depend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the principle of superposition: *the magnetic field of several sources is the vector addition of magnetic field of each individual source*.

### 4.2.2 Magnetic Field, Lorentz Force

Let us suppose that there is a point charge *q* (moving with a velocity **v** and, located at **r** at a given time *t*) in presence of both the electric field **E** (**r**) and the magnetic field **B** (**r**). The force on an electric charge *q* due to both of them can be written as

**F** = *q* [**E** (**r**) + **v** × **B** (**r**)] = **F**_electric_ +**F**_magnetic_ (4.3)

This force was given first by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive experiments of Ampere and others. It is called the Lorentz force. You have already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If we look at the interaction with the magnetic field, we find the following features.

*   (i) It depends on *q*, **v** and **B** (charge of the particle, the velocity and the magnetic field). Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a positive charge.
*   (ii) The magnetic force *q* [**v** × **B** ] includes a vector product of velocity and magnetic field. The vector product makes the force due to magnetic

In order to explain the observed effect of magnetic fields on emitters of light (Zeeman effect), he postulated the existence of electric charges in the atom, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. He derived a set of transformation equations (known after him, as Lorentz transformation equations) by some tangled mathematical arguments, but he was not aware that these equations hinge on a new concept of space and time.

field vanish (become zero) if velocity and magnetic field are parallel or anti-parallel. The force acts in a (sideways) direction perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field. Its direction is given by the screw rule or right hand rule for vector (or cross) product as illustrated in Fig. 4.2.

**FIGURE 4.2** The direction of the magnetic force acting on a charged particle. (a) The force on a positively charged particle with velocity **v** and making an angle $\theta$ with the magnetic field **B** is given by the right-hand rule. (b) A moving charged particle *q* is deflected in an opposite sense to -*q* in the presence of magnetic field.

(iii) The magnetic force is zero if charge is not moving (as then |**v**|= 0). Only a moving charge feels the magnetic force.
The expression for the magnetic force helps us to define the unit of the magnetic field, if one takes *q*, **F** and **v**, all to be unity in the force equation **F** = *q* [**v** × **B**] =*q v B* sin $\theta$ **n̂**, where $\theta$ is the angle between **v** and **B** [see Fig. 4.2 (a)]. The magnitude of magnetic field *B* is 1 SI unit, when the force acting on a unit charge (1 C), moving perpendicular to **B** with a speed 1m/s, is one newton.
Dimensionally, we have [*B*] = [*F*/*qv*] and the unit of **B** are Newton second / (coulomb metre). This unit is called *tesla* (T) named after Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943). *Tesla* is a rather large unit. A smaller unit (non-SI) called *gauss* (=10⁻⁴ tesla) is also often used. The earth's magnetic field is about 3.6 × 10⁻⁵ T.

### 4.2.3 Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor

We can extend the analysis for force due to magnetic field on a single moving charge to a straight rod carrying current. Consider a rod of a uniform cross-sectional area *A* and length *l*. We shall assume one kind of mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the number density of these mobile charge carriers in it be *n*. Then the total number of mobile charge carriers in it is *nlA*. For a steady current *I* in this conducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average drift velocity **v**_d_ (see Chapter 3). In the presence of an external magnetic field **B**, the force on these carriers is:

**F** = (*nlA*) *q* **v**_d_ × **B**

where *q* is the value of the charge on a carrier. Now *nq***v**_d_ is the current density **j** and |(*nq***v**_d_)|*A* is the current *I* (see Chapter 3 for the discussion of current and current density). Thus,

**F** = [(*nq***v**_d_)*lA*] × **B** = [ **j***Al* ] × **B**
= *I***l** × **B** (4.4)

where **l** is a vector of magnitude *l*, the length of the rod, and with a direction identical to the current *I*. Note that the current *I* is not a vector. In the last step leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from **j** to **l**.
Equation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, **B** is the external magnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carrying rod. If the wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz force on it by considering it as a collection of linear strips **dl**_j_ and summing

**F** = Σ_j_ *I***dl**_j_ × **B**

This summation can be converted to an integral in most cases.

### Example 4.1
A straight wire of mass 200 g and length 1.5 m carries a current of 2 A. It is suspended in mid-air by a uniform horizontal magnetic field **B** (Fig. 4.3). What is the magnitude of the magnetic field?

FIGURE 4.3

**Solution** From Eq. (4.4), we find that there is an upward force **F**, of magnitude *IlB*. For mid-air suspension, this must be balanced by the force due to gravity:
mg = I l B
B = mg / Il
B = (0.2 × 9.8) / (2 × 1.5)
B = 0.65 T

Note that it would have been sufficient to specify m/l, the mass per unit length of the wire. The earth's magnetic field is approximately 4 × 10⁻⁵ T and we have ignored it.

### Example 4.2
If the magnetic field is parallel to the positive *y*-axis and the charged particle is moving along the positive *x*-axis (Fig. 4.4), which way would the Lorentz force be for (a) an electron (negative charge), (b) a proton (positive charge).

FIGURE 4.4

**Solution** The velocity **v** of particle is along the *x*-axis, while **B**, the magnetic field is along the *y*-axis, so **v** × **B** is along the *z*-axis (screw rule or right-hand thumb rule). So, (a) for electron it will be along –*z* axis. (b) for a positive charge (proton) the force is along +*z* axis.

We will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in a magnetic field. We have learnt in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter 5) that a force on a particle does work if the force has a component along (or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion of a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude of the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be changed). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, `qE`, which *can* have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus can transfer energy in addition to momentum.]

We shall consider motion of a charged particle in a *uniform magnetic field*. First consider the case of **v** perpendicular to **B**. The perpendicular force, `q **v** × **B**`, acts as a centripetal force and produces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field. *The particle will describe a circle if **v** and **B** are perpendicular to each other* (Fig. 4.5).

FIGURE 4.5 Circular motion

If velocity has a component along **B**, this component remains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will not be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane perpendicular to **B** is as before a circular one, thereby producing *a helical motion* (Fig. 4.6).

You have already learnt in earlier classes (See Class XI, Chapter 3) that if `r` is the radius of the circular path of a particle, then a force of `mv²/r`, acts perpendicular to the path towards the centre of the circle, and is called the centripetal force. If the velocity **v** is perpendicular to the magnetic field **B**, the magnetic force is perpendicular to both **v** and **B** and acts like a centripetal force. It has a magnitude `qvB`.
Equating the two expressions for centripetal force,
`m v²/r = q v B`, which gives
`r = mv/qB` (4.5)
for the radius of the circle described by the charged particle. The larger the momentum, the larger is the radius and bigger the circle described. If `ω` is the angular frequency, then `v = ω r`. So,
`ω = 2π ν = q B/ m` [4.6(a)]
which is independent of the velocity or energy. Here `ν` is the frequency of rotation. The independence of `ν` from energy has important application in the design of a cyclotron.
The time taken for one revolution is `T = 2π/ω = 1/ν`. If there is a component of the velocity parallel to the magnetic field (denoted by `v||`), it will make the particle move along the field and the path of the

particle would be a helical one (Fig. 4.6). The distance moved along the magnetic field in one rotation is called pitch *p*. Using Eq. [4.6 (a)], we have
p = v_|| T = 2πmν / q B
[4.6(b)]
The radius of the circular component of motion is called the radius of the *helix*.

**Example 4.3** What is the radius of the path of an electron (mass 9 × 10⁻³¹ kg and charge 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) moving at a speed of 3 × 10⁷ m/s in a magnetic field of 6 × 10⁻⁴ T perpendicular to it? What is its frequency? Calculate its energy in keV. (1 eV = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ J).

**Solution** Using Eq. (4.5) we find
r = mv / (qB) = 9 × 10⁻³¹ kg × 3 × 10⁷ m s⁻¹ / (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C × 6 × 10⁻⁴ T)
= 28 × 10⁻² m = 28 cm
ν = v / (2 πr) = 17 × 10⁶ s⁻¹ = 17 × 10⁶ Hz = 17 MHz.
E = (½)mv² = (½) 9 × 10⁻³¹ kg × 9 × 10¹⁴ m²/s² = 40.5 × 10⁻¹⁷ J
≈ 4 × 10⁻¹⁶ J = 2.5 keV.

### 4.4 Magnetic Field Due to a Current Element, Biot-Savart Law

All magnetic fields that we know are due to currents (or moving charges) and due to intrinsic magnetic moments of particles. Here, we shall study the relation between current and the magnetic field it produces. It is given by the Biot-Savart's law. Fig. 4.7 shows a finite conductor XY carrying current I. Consider an infinitesimal element dl of the conductor. The magnetic field dB due to this element is to be determined at a point P which is at a distance r from it. Let θ be the angle between dl and the displacement vector r. According to Biot-Savart's law, the magnitude of the magnetic field dB is proportional to the current I, the element length |dl|, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r. Its direction\* is perpendicular to the plane containing dl and r. Thus, in vector notation,

dB ∝ (I dl × r) / r³

= (μ₀ / 4π) (I dl × r) / r³
[4.7(a)]

where μ₀/4π is a constant of proportionality. The above expression holds when the medium is vacuum.

FIGURE 4.7 Illustration of the Biot-Savart law. The current element I dl produces a field dB at a distance r. The ⊗ sign indicates that the field is perpendicular to the plane of this page and directed into it.

\* The sense of dl × r is also given by the **Right Hand Screw** rule : Look at the plane containing vectors dl and r. Imagine moving from the first vector towards second vector. If the movement is anticlockwise, the resultant is towards you. If it is clockwise, the resultant is away from you.

## Physics
The magnitude of this field is,
$|dB| = \frac{\mu_0 I dl \sin \theta}{r^2} \quad [4.7(b)]$

where we have used the property of cross-product. Equation [4.7(a)] constitutes our basic equation for the magnetic field. The proportionality constant in SI units has the exact value,
$\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} = 10^{-7} \text{Tm/A} \quad [4.7(c)]$

We call $\mu_0$ the *permeability* of free space (or vacuum).
The Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field has certain similarities, as well as, differences with the Coulomb's law for the electrostatic field. Some of these are:
- (i) Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of distance from the source to the point of interest. The principle of superposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note that the magnetic field is *linear* in the *source Idl* just as the electrostatic field is linear in its source: the electric charge.]
- (ii) The electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the electric charge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source I dl.
- (iii) The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the source and the field point. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane containing the displacement vector r and the current element I dl.
- (iv) There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is not present in the electrostatic case. In Fig. 4.7, the magnetic field at any point in the direction of dl (the dashed line) is zero. Along this line, $\theta = 0$, $\sin \theta = 0$ and from Eq. [4.7(a)], $|dB| = 0$.

There is an interesting relation between $\epsilon_0$, the permittivity of free space; $\mu_0$, the permeability of free space; and c, the speed of light in vacuum:
$\epsilon_0 \mu_0 = (4\pi \epsilon_0) \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{9 \times 10^9} (10^{-7}) = \frac{1}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{1}{c^2}$

We will discuss this connection further in Chapter 8 on the electromagnetic waves. Since the speed of light in vacuum is constant, the product $\mu_0 \epsilon_0$ is fixed in magnitude. Choosing the value of either $\epsilon_0$ or $\mu_0$, fixes the value of the other. In SI units, $\mu_0$ is fixed to be equal to $4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ in magnitude.

An element $\Delta \mathbf{l} = \Delta x \hat{\mathbf{i}}$ is placed at the origin and carries a large current I = 10 A (Fig. 4.8). What is the magnetic field on the y-axis at a distance of 0.5 m. $\Delta x = 1$ cm.

### Solution

|**dB**| = `(μ₀ / 4π)` `(I dl sin θ / r²) `[using Eq. (4.7)]

`dl = Δx = 10⁻² m, I = 10 A, r = 0.5 m = y, μ₀ / 4π = 10⁻⁷ Tm/A`

`θ = 90°; sin θ = 1`

|**dB**| = `(10⁻⁷ × 10 × 10⁻²) / (25 × 10⁻²) = 4 × 10⁻⁸ T`

The direction of the field is in the +z-direction. This is so since,

`dl x r = Δx i x y j = y Δx (i x j) = y Δx k`

We remind you of the following cyclic property of cross-products,
`i x j = k; j x k = i; k x i = j`

Note that the field is small in magnitude.

### EXAMPLE 4.4

In the next section, we shall use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field due to a circular loop.

## 4.5 MAGNETIC FIELD ON THE AXIS OF A CIRCULAR CURRENT LOOP

In this section, we shall evaluate the magnetic field due to a circular coil along its axis. The evaluation entails summing up the effect of infinitesimal current elements (*I dl*) mentioned in the previous section. We assume that the current *I* is steady and that the evaluation is carried out in free space (i.e., vacuum).

Fig. 4.9 depicts a circular loop carrying a steady current *I*. The loop is placed in the *y-z* plane with its centre at the origin O and has a radius *R*. The *x*-axis is the axis of the loop. We wish to calculate the magnetic field at the point P on this axis. Let *x* be the distance of P from the centre O of the loop.

Consider a conducting element *dl* of the loop. This is shown in Fig. 4.9. The magnitude *dB* of the magnetic field due to *dl* is given by the Biot-Savart law [Eq. 4.7(a)],

`dB = (μ₀ / 4π) (|I dl x r| / r³) (4.8)`

Now `r² = x² + R²`. Further, any element of the loop will be perpendicular to the displacement vector from the element to the axial point. For example, the element *dl* in Fig. 4.9 is in the *y-z* plane, whereas, the displacement vector *r* from *dl* to the axial point P is in the *x-y* plane. Hence `|dl x r| = r dl`. Thus,

`dB = (μ₀ / 4π) (Idl / (x² + R²)) (4.9)`

## Physics

The direction of d**B** is shown in Fig. 4.9. It is perpendicular to the plane formed by d**l** and **r**. It has an *x*-component d*B*ₓ and a component perpendicular to *x*-axis, d*B*⊥. When the components perpendicular to the *x*-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result. For example, the d*B*⊥ component due to d**l** is cancelled by the contribution due to the diametrically opposite d**l** element, shown in Fig. 4.9. Thus, only the *x*-component survives. The net contribution along *x*-direction can be obtained by integrating d*B*ₓ = d*B* cos θ over the loop. For Fig. 4.9,

cos θ = `R / (x² + R²)^(1/2)` (4.10)

From Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10),

d*B*ₓ = `μ₀Idl R / (4π (x² + R²)^(3/2))`

The summation of elements d*l* over the loop yields 2π*R*, the circumference of the loop. Thus, the magnetic field at P due to entire circular loop is

**B** = *B*ₓ**î** = `μ₀IR² / (2(x² + R²)^(3/2)) î` (4.11)

As a special case of the above result, we may obtain the field at the centre of the loop. Here *x* = 0, and we obtain,

**B**₀ = `μ₀I / 2R î` (4.12)

The magnetic field lines due to a circular wire form closed loops and are shown in Fig. 4.10. The direction of the magnetic field is given by (another) *right-hand thumb rule* stated below:

Curl the palm of your right hand around the circular wire with the fingers pointing in the direction of the current. The *right-hand thumb* gives the direction of the magnetic field.

FIGURE 4.10 The magnetic field lines for a current loop. The direction of the field is given by the *right-hand thumb rule* described in the text. The upper side of the loop may be thought of as the north pole and the lower side as the south pole of a magnet.

### Example 4.5
A straight wire carrying a current of 12 A is bent into a semi-circular arc of radius 2.0 cm as shown in Fig. 4.11(a). Consider the magnetic field **B** at the centre of the arc. (a) What is the magnetic field due to the straight segments? (b) In what way the contribution to **B** from the semicircle differs from that of a circular loop and in what way does it resemble? (c) Would your answer be different if the wire were bent into a semi-circular arc of the same radius but in the opposite way as shown in Fig. 4.11(b)?

(a)
(b)

FIGURE 4.11

**Solution**
- (a) *dl* and *r* for each element of the straight segments are parallel. Therefore, *dl* × *r* = 0. Straight segments do not contribute to |**B**|.
- (b) For all segments of the semicircular arc, *dl* × *r* are all parallel to each other (into the plane of the paper). All such contributions add up in magnitude. Hence direction of **B** for a semicircular arc is given by the right-hand rule and magnitude is half that of a circular loop. Thus **B** is 1.9 × 10⁻⁴ T normal to the plane of the paper going into it.
- (c) Same magnitude of **B** but opposite in direction to that in (b).

### Example 4.6
Consider a tightly wound 100 turn coil of radius 10 cm, carrying a current of 1 A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the centre of the coil?

**Solution**
Since the coil is tightly wound, we may take each circular element to have the same radius *R* = 10 cm = 0.1 m. The number of turns *N* = 100. The magnitude of the magnetic field is,

*B* = (μ₀*NI*) / (2*R*) = (4π × 10⁻⁷ × 10² × 1) / (2 × 10⁻¹) = 2π × 10⁻⁴ = 6.28 × 10⁻⁴ T

## 4.6 AMPERE'S CIRCUITAL LAW

There is an alternative and appealing way in which the Biot-Savart law may be expressed. Ampere's circuital law considers an open surface with a boundary (Fig. 4.12). The surface has current passing through it. We consider the boundary to be made up of a number of small line elements. Consider one such element of length *dl*. We take the value of the tangential component of the magnetic field, *B*ₜ, at this element and multiply it by the

Boundary
Surface
FIGURE 4.12

# Page Number: 120
## Physics

length of that element *dl* [Note: B₁dl=B·dl]. All such products are added together. We consider the limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their number gets larger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere's law states that this integral is equal to µ₀ times the total current passing through the surface, i.e.,

∮ **B**·*dl* = µ₀*I* [4.13(a)]

where *I* is the total current through the surface. The integral is taken over the closed loop coinciding with the boundary C of the surface. The relation above involves a sign-convention, given by the right-hand rule. Let the fingers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the boundary is traversed in the loop integral ∮ **B**·*dl*. Then the direction of the thumb gives the sense in which the current *I* is regarded as positive.

For several applications, a much simplified version of Eq. [4.13(a)] proves sufficient. We shall assume that, in such cases, it is possible to choose the loop (called an *amperian loop*) such that at each point of the loop, either
(i) **B** is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero constant *B*, or
(ii) **B** is normal to the loop, or
(iii) **B** vanishes.

Now, let *L* be the length (part) of the loop for which **B** is tangential. Let *I*ₑ be the current enclosed by the loop. Then, Eq. (4.13) reduces to,

*BL* = µ₀*I*ₑ [4.13(b)]

When there is a system with a symmetry such as for a *straight infinite current-carrying wire* in Fig. 4.13, the Ampere's law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic field, much the same way Gauss’ law helps in determination of the electric field. This is exhibited in the Example 4.8 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is a circle and magnetic field is tangential to the circumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand side of Eq. [4.13 (b)], **B**· 2π*r*. We find that the magnetic field at a distance *r* outside the wire is *tangential* and given by

*B* × 2π*r* = µ₀*I*
*B* = µ₀ *I*/ (2π*r*) (4.14)

The above result for the infinite wire is interesting from several points of view.
(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of radius *r*, (with the wire along the axis), is same in magnitude. In other words, the magnetic field

**Andre Ampere (1775 – 1836)**
Andre Marie Ampere was a French physicist, mathematician and chemist who founded the science of electrodynamics. Ampere was a child prodigy who mastered advanced mathematics by the age of 12. Ampere grasped the significance of Oersted’s discovery. He carried out a large series of experiments to explore the relationship between current electricity and magnetism. These investigations culminated in 1827 with the publication of the 'Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena Deduced Solely from Experiments'. He hypothesised that all magnetic phenomena are due to circulating electric currents. Ampere was humble and absent-minded. He once forgot an invitation to dine with the Emperor Napoleon. He died of pneumonia at the age of 61. His gravestone bears the epitaph: *Tandem Felix* (Happy at last).

Solution (a) Consider the case *r* > *a*. The Amperian loop, labelled 2,
is a circle concentric with the cross-section. For this loop,
*L* = 2π*r*
*I*<sub>e</sub> = Current enclosed by the loop = *I*
The result is the familiar expression for a long straight wire
*B* (2π*r*) = μ₀*I*

*B* = μ₀*I* / 2π*r* [4.15(a)]

*B* ∝ 1/*r* (*r* > *a*)

Now the current enclosed *I*<sub>e</sub> is not *I*, but is less than this value.
Since the current distribution is uniform, the current enclosed is,

*I*<sub>e</sub> = *I* (π*r*² / π*a*²) = *I*r*² / *a*²

Using Ampere's law, *B*(2π*r*) = μ₀*I*r*² / *a*²

*B* = (μ₀*I* / 2π*a*²)*r* [4.15(b)]

*B* ∝ *r* (*r* < *a*)

## EXAMPLE 4.7
### FIGURE 4.14
Figure (4.14) shows a plot of the magnitude of *B* with distance *r*
from the centre of the wire. The direction of the field is tangential to
the respective circular loop (1 or 2) and given by the right-hand
rule described earlier in this section.

This example possesses the required symmetry so that Ampere's
law can be applied readily.

It should be noted that while Ampere's circuital law holds for any
loop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in
every case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in
Section 4.5, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression
*B* = μ₀*I*/2*R* [Eq. (4.12)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However,
there exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law
can be conveniently applied. We shall use it in the next section to calculate

the magnetic field produced by a commonly used and very useful magnetic system: the *solenoid*.

## 4.7 The Solenoid

We shall discuss a long solenoid. By long solenoid we mean that the solenoid's length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long wire wound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely spaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop. The net magnetic field is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns. Enamelled wires are used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.

FIGURE 4.15 (a) The magnetic field due to a section of the solenoid which has been stretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown. Notice how the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel. (b) The magnetic field of a finite solenoid.

Figure 4.15 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid. We show a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner in Fig. 4.15(a). Figure 4.15(b) shows the entire finite solenoid with its magnetic field. In Fig. 4.15(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the field between two neighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.15(b), we see that the field at the interior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid. The field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the axis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As the

## Physics
solenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet.
Figure 4.16 represents this idealised picture. The field outside the solenoid
approaches zero. We shall assume that the field outside is zero. The field
inside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.
Consider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd. Along cd the field is zero
as argued above. Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field component
is zero. Thus, these two sections make no contribution. Let the field along
ab be *B*. Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, *L = h*.
Let *n* be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number
of turns is *nh*. The enclosed current is, *I_e = I (nh)*, where *I* is the current
in the solenoid. From Ampere’s circuital law [Eq. 4.13 (b)]
*BL = μ_0 I_e, Bh = μ_0 I (nh)*
*B = μ_0 n I* (4.16)
The direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoid
is commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field. We shall see in the
next chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft iron core
inside the solenoid.

**Example 4.8** A solenoid of length 0.5 m has a radius of 1 cm and is
made up of 500 turns. It carries a current of 5 A. What is the
magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?
**Solution** The number of turns per unit length is,
*n = 500 / 0.5 = 1000 turns/m*
The length *l* = 0.5 m and radius *r* = 0.01 m. Thus, *l/a* = 50 i.e., *l >> a*.
Hence, we can use the **long solenoid formula**, namely, Eq. (4.20)
*B = μ_0 n I*
`= 4π × 10^-7 x 10^3 x 5`
`= 6.28 × 10^-3 T`

**FIGURE 4.17** Two long straight
parallel conductors carrying steady
currents *I_a* and *I_b*, and separated by a

set up by conductor ‘a’ at conductor ‘b’.

## 4.8 FORCE BETWEEN TWO PARALLEL CURRENTS, THE AMPERE
We have learnt that there exists a magnetic field due to a
conductor carrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savart
law. Further, we have learnt that an external magnetic field
will exert a force on a current-carrying conductor. This
follows from the Lorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical
to expect that two current-carrying conductors placed near
each other will exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In
the period 1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this
magnetic force and its dependence on the magnitude of
the current, on the shape and size of the conductors, as
well as, the distances between the conductors. In this
section, we shall take the simple example of two parallel
current- carrying conductors, which will perhaps help us
to appreciate Ampere’s painstaking work.

Figure 4.17 shows two long parallel conductors a and b separated by a distance *d* and carrying (parallel) currents *I*<sub>a</sub> and *I*<sub>b</sub>, respectively. The conductor ‘a’ produces, the same magnetic field **B**<sub>a</sub> at all points along the conductor ‘b’. The right-hand rule tells us that the direction of this field is downwards (when the conductors are placed horizontally). Its magnitude is given by Eq. [4.15(a)] or from Ampere's circuital law,

B<sub>a</sub> = µ<sub>0</sub>I<sub>a</sub> / (2πd)

The conductor ‘b’ carrying a current *I*<sub>b</sub> will experience a sideways force due to the field **B**<sub>a</sub>. The direction of this force is towards the conductor ‘a’ (Verify this). We label this force as **F**<sub>ba</sub>, the force on a segment *L* of ‘b’ due to ‘a’. The magnitude of this force is given by Eq. (4.4),

F<sub>ba</sub> = I<sub>b</sub>L B<sub>a</sub>
= µ<sub>0</sub>I<sub>a</sub>I<sub>b</sub>L / (2πd) (4.17)

It is of course possible to compute the force on ‘a’ due to ‘b’. From considerations similar to above we can find the force **F**<sub>ab</sub>, on a segment of length *L* of ‘a’ due to the current in ‘b’. It is equal in magnitude to F<sub>ba</sub>, and directed towards ‘b’. Thus,

F<sub>ba</sub> = -F<sub>ab</sub> (4.18)

Note that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least for parallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the Biot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with Newton’s third Law\*.

We have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction attract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel each other. Thus,

*Parallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.*

This rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same sign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each other. Let *f*<sub>ba</sub> represent the magnitude of the force **F**<sub>ba</sub> per unit length. Then, from Eq. (4.17),

*f*<sub>ba</sub> = µ<sub>0</sub>I<sub>a</sub>I<sub>b</sub> / (2πd) (4.19)

The above expression is used to define the ampere (A), which is one of the seven SI base units.

-   It turns out that when we have time-dependent currents and/or charges in motion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or conductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics is conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds even for the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided the momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.

The *ampere* is the value of that steady current which, when maintained in each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible cross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce on each of these conductors a force equal to `2 × 10⁻⁷` newtons per metre of length.

This definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoretical definition. In practice, one must eliminate the effect of the earth's magnetic field and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate geometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measure this mechanical force.

The SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in terms of the ampere.

When a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of charge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb (1C).

**Example 4.9** The horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field at a certain place is `3.0 ×10⁻⁵` T and the direction of the field is from the geographic south to the geographic north. A very long straight conductor is carrying a steady current of 1A. What is the force per unit length on it when it is placed on a horizontal table and the direction of the current is (a) east to west; (b) south to north?

**Solution** `F = Il × B`
`F = IlB sinθ`
The force per unit length is
`f = F/l = I B sinθ`
(a) When the current is flowing from east to west,
`θ = 90°`
Hence,
`f = I B`
`= 1 × 3 × 10⁻⁵ = 3 × 10⁻⁵ N m⁻¹`
This is larger than the value `2×10⁻⁷ Nm⁻¹` quoted in the definition of the ampere. Hence it is important to eliminate the effect of the earth's magnetic field and other stray fields while standardising the ampere.
The direction of the force is downwards. This direction may be obtained by the directional property of cross product of vectors.
(b) When the current is flowing from south to north,
`θ = 0°`
`f = 0`
Hence there is no force on the conductor.

## 4.9 TORQUE ON CURRENT LOOP, MAGNETIC DIPOLE
### 4.9.1 Torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform magnetic field

We now show that a rectangular loop carrying a steady current *I* and placed in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. It does not experience a net force. This behaviour is analogous to that of electric dipole in a uniform electric field (Section 1.11).

We first consider the simple case when the rectangular loop is placed such that the uniform magnetic field **B** is in the plane of the loop. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.18(a).

The field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC of the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB of the loop and exerts a force **F₁** on it which is directed into the plane of the loop. Its magnitude is,
`F₁ = Ib B`
Similarly, it exerts a force **F₂** on the arm CD and **F₂** is directed out of the plane of the paper.

`F₂ = I b B = F₁`

Thus, the net force on the loop is zero. There is a torque on the loop due to the pair of forces **F₁** and **F₂**. Figure 4.18(b) shows a view of the loop from the AD end. It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotate it anticlockwise. This torque is (in magnitude),

`τ = F₁ (a/2) + F₂ (a/2)`
`  = IbB (a/2) + IbB (a/2) = I(ab)B`
`  = I A B`
(4.20)

where A = ab is the area of the rectangle.

We next consider the case when the plane of the loop, is not along the magnetic field, but makes an angle with it. We take the angle between the field and the normal to the coil to be angle θ (The previous case corresponds to θ = π/2). Figure 4.19 illustrates this general case.

**FIGURE 4.18** (a) A rectangular current-carrying coil in uniform magnetic field. The magnetic moment **m** points downwards. The torque **τ** is along the axis and tends to rotate the coil anticlockwise. (b) The couple acting on the coil.

The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along the axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA. Being collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net force or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are **F₁** and **F₂**. They too are equal and opposite, with magnitude,

`F₁ = F₂ = I b B`

But they are not collinear! This results in a couple as before. The torque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop was along the magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular distance between the forces of the couple has decreased. Figure 4.19(b) is a view of the arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates these two forces constituting a couple. The magnitude of the torque on the loop is,

`τ = F₁ (a/2) sin θ + F₂ (a/2) sin θ`
`  = I ab B sin θ`
`  = I A B sin θ`

FIGURE 4.19 (a) The area vector of the loop ABCD makes an arbitrary angle θ with the magnetic field. (b) Top view of the loop. The forces F₁ and F₂ acting on the arms AB and CD are indicated.

As θ → 0, the perpendicular distance between the forces of the couple also approaches zero. This makes the forces collinear and the net force and torque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21) can be expressed as vector product of the magnetic moment of the coil and the magnetic field. We define the *magnetic moment* of the current loop as,

**m** = *I***A** (4.22)

where the direction of the area vector **A** is given by the right-hand thumb rule and is directed into the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.18. Then as the angle between **m** and **B** is θ, Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21) can be expressed by one expression

**τ** = **m** × **B** (4.23)

This is analogous to the electrostatic case (Electric dipole of dipole moment **p**_e in an electric field **E**).

**τ** = **p**_e x **E**

As is clear from Eq. (4.22), the dimensions of the magnetic moment are [A][L²] and its unit is Am². From Eq. (4.23), we see that the torque **τ** vanishes when **m** is either parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field **B**. This indicates a state of equilibrium as there is no torque on the coil (this also applies to any object with a magnetic moment **m**). When **m** and **B** are parallel the equilibrium is a stable one. Any small rotation of the coil produces a torque which brings it back to its original position. When they are antiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces a torque which increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of this torque is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole aligns itself with the external magnetic field.

If the loop has *N* closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq. (4.23), still holds, with

**m** = *N***I***A** (4.24)

A 100 turn closely wound circular coil of radius 10 cm carries a current of 3.2 A. (a) What is the field at the centre of the coil? (b) What is the magnetic moment of this coil?

The coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about a horizontal axis which coincides with its diameter. A uniform magnetic field of 2T in the horizontal direction exists such that initially the axis of the coil is in the direction of the field. The coil rotates through an angle of 90° under the influence of the magnetic field. (c) What are the magnitudes of the torques on the coil in the initial and final position? (d) What is the angular speed acquired by the coil when it has rotated by 90°? The moment of inertia of the coil is 0.1 kg m².

### Solution
(a) From Eq. (4.12)
B = μ₀NI / 2R
Here, N = 100; I = 3.2 A, and R = 0.1 m. Hence,
B = (4π×10⁻⁷×3.2) / (2×10⁻¹) = (4×10⁻⁵×10) / (2×10⁻¹) (using π × 3.2 = 10)
= 2 × 10⁻³ T
The direction is given by the right-hand thumb rule.
(b) The magnetic moment is given by Eq. (4.24),
m = NI A = NIπr² = 100 × 3.2 × 3.14 × 10⁻² = 10 A m²
The direction is once again given by the right-hand thumb rule.
(c) τ = |m × B| [from Eq. (4.23)]
= m B sin θ
Initially, θ = 0. Thus, initial torque τ_i = 0. Finally, θ = π/2 (or 90°).
Thus, final torque τ_f = m B = 10 × 2 = 20 N m.
(d) From Newton's second law,
J dω/dt = mB sinθ
where J is the moment of inertia of the coil. From chain rule,
dω/dt = (dω/dθ) * (dθ/dt) = (dω/dθ) * ω
Using this,
J ωdω = m B sin θ dθ
Integrating from θ = 0 to θ = π/2,
∫₀^(ω_f) J ωdω = ∫₀^(π/2) mB sin θ dθ
J (ω_f² / 2) = m B [-cos θ]₀^(π/2) = m B
ω_f = ((2mB)/J)^(1/2) = ((2×20)/(10⁻¹))^(1/2) = 20s⁻¹

**m** → **p**_e (electrostatic dipole)

considered in Chapter 1, Section 1.9 [Eq. (1.20)].
It can be shown that the above analogy can be carried further. We
had found in Chapter 1 that the electric field on the perpendicular bisector
of the dipole is given by [See Eq.(1.21)],

**E** = **p**_e / (4πε_0 x^3)

where x is the distance from the dipole. If we replace **p** → **m** and μ_0 → 1/ε_0
in the above expression, we obtain the result for **B** for a point in the
plane of the loop at a distance x from the centre. For x>>R,

**B** = μ_0 **m** / (4π x^3) x >> R [4.25(b)]

The results given by Eqs. [4.25(a)] and [4.25(b)] become exact for a
point magnetic dipole.
The results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:
a planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment
**m** = IA, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment **p**. Note, however,
a fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary
units — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic
dipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent
of electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.
We have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see
Fig. 4.10) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and
(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest
that all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly
true and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,
elementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an *intrinsic*
magnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.

## 4.10 THE MOVING COIL GALVANOMETER

Currents and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in
Chapters 3. But how do we measure them? How do we claim that
current in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?
Figure 4.20 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the *moving
coil galvanometer* (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understood
on the basis of our discussion in Section 4.9.
The galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate
about a fixed axis (Fig. 4.20), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is
a cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also
increases the strength of the magnetic field. When a current flows through
the coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.20) to be

where the symbols have their usual meaning. Since the field is radial by design, we have taken sin θ = 1 in the above expression for the torque. The magnetic torque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring S_p provides a counter torque `kφ` that balances the magnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a steady angular deflection `φ`. In equilibrium

`kφ = NI AB`

where `k` is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the restoring torque per unit twist. The deflection `φ` is indicated on the scale by a pointer attached to the spring. We have

`φ = (NAB / k) I` (4.26)

The quantity in brackets is a constant for a given galvanometer.
The galvanometer can be used in a number of ways. It can be used as a detector to check if a current is flowing in the circuit. We have come across this usage in the Wheatstone's bridge arrangement. In this usage the neutral position of the pointer (when no current is flowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle of the scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.20. Depending on the direction of the current, the pointer's deflection is either to the right or the left.

The galvanometer cannot as such be used as an ammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is for two reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-scale deflection for a current of the order of µA. (ii) For measuring currents, the galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large resistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. To overcome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance `r_s`, called *shunt resistance*, in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the current passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,

**(Diagram of Ammeter with shunt resistance)**
*   **G** (Galvanometer)
*   **R_G** (Resistance of galvanometer)
*   **r_s** (Shunt resistance)
*   **Ammeter**

`R_G r_s / (R_G + r_s) ≈ r_s` if `R_G >> r_s`

**FIGURE 4.21** Conversion of a galvanometer (G) to an ammeter by the introduction of a shunt resistance `r_s` of very small value in parallel.

If `r_s` has small value, in relation to the resistance of the rest of the circuit `R_c`, the effect of introducing the measuring instrument is also small and negligible. This arrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.21. The scale of this ammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off the current value with ease. We define the *current sensitivity* of the galvanometer as the deflection per unit current. From Eq. (4.26) this current sensitivity is,

`φ / I = NAB / k` (4.27)

A convenient way for the manufacturer to increase the sensitivity is to increase the number of turns N. We choose galvanometers having sensitivities of value, required by our experiment.

## Moving Charges and Magnetism

The galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the voltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected *in parallel* with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very small current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original set up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the disturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent. To ensure this, a large resistance *R* is connected *in series* with the galvanometer. This arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.22. Note that the resistance of the voltmeter is now,
R<sub>G</sub> + R ≈ R: large

**FIGURE 4.22**
Conversion of a galvanometer (G) to a voltmeter by the introduction of a resistance *R* of large value in series.

The scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage value with ease. We define the *voltage sensitivity* as the deflection per unit voltage. From Eq. (4.26),

`ϕ/V = (NAB/k) (I/V) = (NAB/k) (1/R)` (4.28)

An interesting point to note is that increasing the current sensitivity may not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity. Let us take Eq. (4.27) which provides a measure of current sensitivity. If *N* → 2*N*, i.e., we double the number of turns, then

`ϕ/I → 2ϕ/I`

Thus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of the galvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the length of the wire. In Eq. (4.28), *N*→2*N*, and *R*→2*R*, thus the voltage sensitivity,

`ϕ/V → ϕ/V`

remains unchanged. So in general, the modification needed for conversion of a galvanometer to an ammeter will be different from what is needed for converting it into a voltmeter.

1.  The total force on a charge q moving with velocity **v** in the presence of
    magnetic and electric fields **B** and **E**, respectively is called the *Lorentz*
    *force*. It is given by the expression:
    **F** = q (**v** × **B** + **E**)
    The magnetic force q (**v** × **B**) is normal to **v** and work done by it is zero.
2.  A straight conductor of length *l* and carrying a steady current *I*
    experiences a force **F** in a uniform external magnetic field **B**,
    **F** = *I***l** × **B**
    where|**l**| = *l* and the direction of **l** is given by the direction of the
    current.
3.  In a uniform magnetic field **B**, a charge q executes a circular orbit in
    a plane normal to **B**. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called
    the *cyclotron frequency* and is given by:
    $\nu_c = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}$
    This frequency is independent of the particle's speed and radius. This
    fact is exploited in a machine, the *cyclotron*, which is used to
    accelerate charged particles.
4.  The *Biot-Savart* law asserts that the magnetic field d**B** due to an
    element d**l** carrying a steady current *I* at a point P at a distance *r* from
    the current element is:
    $\text{d**B**} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{I \text{d**l**} \times \textbf{r}}{r^3}$
    To obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expression
    over the entire length of the conductor.
5.  The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a circular coil of radius *R*
    carrying a current *I* at an axial distance *x* from the centre is

$B = \frac{\mu_0 IR^2}{2(x^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}$

At the centre this reduces to

$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2R}$

6.  **Ampere's Circuital Law**: Let an open surface S be bounded by a loop C. Then the Ampere's law states that $\oint_c \mathbf{B}.\mathbf{dl} = \mu_0 I$ where *I* refers to the current passing through S. The sign of *I* is determined from the right-hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If **B** is directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter *L* of a closed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then,
    $BL = \mu_0 I_e$
    where *Iₑ* is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.

7.  The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance *R* from a long, straight wire carrying a current *I* is given by:
    $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi R}$

    The field lines are circles concentric with the wire.

8.  The magnitude of the field **B** inside a long *solenoid* carrying a current *I* is
    $B = \mu_0 n I$
    where *n* is the number of turns per unit length.

9.  Parallel currents attract and anti-parallel currents repel.

10. A planar loop carrying a current *I*, having *N* closely wound turns, and an area *A* possesses a magnetic moment **m** where,
    **m** = *N I A*

    and the direction of **m** is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl the palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing in the direction of the current. The thumb sticking out gives the direction of **m** (and A)

    When this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field **B**, the force **F** on it is: *F* = 0
    And the torque on it is,
    $\tau = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}$
    In a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter-torque due to a spring, yielding
    $k\phi = NIAB$
    where $\phi$ is the equilibrium deflection and *k* the torsion constant of the spring.

11. A moving coil galvanometer can be converted into a ammeter by introducing a shunt resistance *rₛ*, of small value in parallel. It can be converted into a voltmeter by introducing a resistance of a large value in series.

# 1 REAL NUMBERS

## 1.1 Introduction

In Class IX, you began your exploration of the world of real numbers and encountered irrational numbers. We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We begin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the Euclid's division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

Euclid's division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of integers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer *a* can be divided by another positive integer *b* in such a way that it leaves a remainder *r* that is smaller than *b*. Many of you probably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite easy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of two positive integers.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something with multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way—this important fact is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and understand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics. We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we use it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as √2, √3 and √5. Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal expansion of a rational number, say `p/q` (`q ≠ 0`), is terminating and when it is non-terminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator *q* of `p/q`. You will see that the prime factorisation of *q* will completely reveal the nature of the decimal expansion of `p/q`.

So let us begin our exploration.

## 1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

In your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a product of its prime factors. For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 11 × 23, and so on. Now, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any natural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.

Take any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply some or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish, we can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many). Let us list a few :
7 × 11 × 23 = 1771
2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 10626
2² × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 21252
and so on.
3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 5313
2³ x 3 x 7³ = 8232

Now, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes. What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite number of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So, if we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite collection of numbers, all the primes and all possible products of primes. The question is – can we produce all the composite numbers this way? What do you think? Do you think that there may be a composite number which is not the product of powers of primes? Before we answer this, let us factorise positive integers, that is, do the opposite of what we have done so far.

We are going to use the factor tree with which you are all familiar. Let us take some large number, say, 32760, and factorise it as shown.

## REAL NUMBERS
So we have factorised 32760 as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of primes, i.e., 32760 = 2³ × 3² × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try another number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 3² × 3803 × 3607. Of course, you have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural numbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be written as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** because of its basic crucial importance to the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.

**Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)**: Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.

An equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid's Elements, before it came to be known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae*.

Carl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the 'Prince of Mathematicians' and is considered one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Archimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental contributions to both mathematics and science.

**Carl Friedrich Gauss**
**(1777 – 1855)**

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can be factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any composite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a '*unique*' way, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite number there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we are not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we regard 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 as the same as 3 × 5 × 7 × 2, or any other possible order in which these primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form:

*The prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order of its factors.*

## MATHEMATICS

In general, given a composite number x, we factorise it as x = p₁ p₂ ... pₙ, where p₁, p₂,..., pₙ are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., p₁ ≤ p₂ ≤... ≤ pₙ. If we combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example,
32760 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 = 2³ × 3² × 5 × 7 × 13
Once we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number is factorised, is unique.
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within mathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples.

### Example 1:
Consider the numbers 4ⁿ, where n is a natural number. Check whether there is any value of n for which 4ⁿ ends with the digit zero.

**Solution:** If the number 4ⁿ, for any n, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be divisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4ⁿ would contain the prime 5. This is not possible because 4ⁿ = (2²)ⁿ; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4ⁿ is 2. So, the uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no other primes in the factorisation of 4ⁿ. So, there is no natural number n for which 4ⁿ ends with the digit zero.

You have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it! This method is also called the prime factorisation method. Let us recall this method through an example.

### Example 2:
Find the LCM and HCF of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method.

**Solution:** We have:
6 = 2¹ × 3¹ and 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 = 2² × 5¹.
You can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60, as done in your earlier classes.

Note that HCF(6, 20) = 2¹ = **Product of the smallest power of each common prime factor in the numbers.**
LCM (6, 20) = 2² × 3¹ × 5¹ = **Product of the greatest power of each prime factor, involved in the numbers.**

From the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) × LCM(6, 20) = 6 × 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers **a** and **b**, HCF (**a**, **b**) × LCM (**a**, **b**) = **a** × **b**. We can use this result to find the LCM of two positive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers.

### Example 3:
Find the HCF of 96 and 404 by the prime factorisation method. Hence, find their LCM.

## REAL NUMBERS
**Solution** : The prime factorisation of 96 and 404 gives :
96 = 2⁵ × 3, 404 = 2² × 101
Therefore, the HCF of these two integers is 2² = 4.
Also,
LCM (96, 404) = (96 × 404) / HCF(96, 404) = (96 × 404) / 4 = 9696

**Example 4** : Find the HCF and LCM of 6, 72 and 120, using the prime factorisation method.
**Solution** : We have :
6 = 2 × 3, 72 = 2³ × 3², 120 = 2³ × 3 × 5
Here, 2¹ and 3¹ are the smallest powers of the common factors 2 and 3, respectively.
So,
HCF (6, 72, 120) = 2¹ × 3¹ = 2 × 3 = 6
2³, 3² and 5¹ are the greatest powers of the prime factors 2, 3 and 5 respectively involved in the three numbers.
So,
LCM (6, 72, 120) = 2³ × 3² × 5¹ = 360

**Remark** : Notice, 6 × 72 × 120 ≠ HCF (6, 72, 120) × LCM (6, 72, 120). So, the product of three numbers is not equal to the product of their HCF and LCM.

## 1.3 Revisiting Irrational Numbers

In Class IX, you were introduced to irrational numbers and many of their properties. You studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together made up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number line. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will prove that `sqrt(2)`, `sqrt(3)`, `sqrt(5)` and, in general, `sqrt(p)` is irrational, where `p` is a prime. One of the theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

Recall, a number ‘s' is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form `p/q`, where `p` and `q` are integers and `q ≠ 0`. Some examples of irrational numbers, with which you are already familiar, are :
`sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(15), π, -sqrt(2)/sqrt(3), 0.10110111011110..., etc.`

Before we prove that `sqrt(2)` is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose proof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

**Theorem 1.2** : Let p be a prime number. If p divides a², then p divides a, where a is a positive integer.

*Proof*:
Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows :
`a = p_1p_2 ... p_n`, where `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` are primes, not necessarily distinct.
Therefore, `a^2 = (p_1p_2 ... p_n)(p_1p_2 ... p_n) = p_1^2p_2^2 ... p_n^2`
Now, we are given that `p` divides `a^2`. Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it follows that `p` is one of the prime factors of `a^2`. However, using the uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only prime factors of `a^2` are `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`. So `p` is one of `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`.
Now, since `a = p_1p_2 ... p_n`, `p` divides `a`.

We are now ready to give a proof that `sqrt(2)` is irrational.
The proof is based on a technique called 'proof by contradiction'. (This technique is discussed in some detail in Appendix 1).

**Theorem 1.3** : `sqrt(2)` is irrational.

Proof: Let us assume, to the contrary, that `sqrt(2)` is rational.

* Not from the examination point of view.

So, we can find integers r and s (≠ 0) such that √2 = r/s.
Suppose r and s have a common factor other than 1. Then, we divide by the common factor to get √2 = a/b, where a and b are coprime.
So, b√2 = a.
Squaring on both sides and rearranging, we get 2b² = a². Therefore, 2 divides a².
Now, by Theorem 1.2, it follows that 2 divides a.
So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c.
Substituting for a, we get 2b² = 4c², that is, b² = 2c².
This means that 2 divides b², and so 2 divides b (again using Theorem 1.2 with p = 2).
Therefore, a and b have at least 2 as a common factor.
But this contradicts the fact that a and b have no common factors other than 1.
This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that √2 is rational.
So, we conclude that √2 is irrational.

## Example 5 : Prove that √3 is irrational.

### Solution :
Let us assume, to the contrary, that √3 is rational.
That is, we can find integers a and b (≠ 0) such that √3 = a/b.
Suppose a and b have a common factor other than 1, then we can divide by the common factor, and assume that a and b are coprime.
So, b√3 = a.
Squaring on both sides, and rearranging, we get 3b² = a².
Therefore, a² is divisible by 3, and by Theorem 1.2, it follows that a is also divisible by 3.
So, we can write a = 3c for some integer c.
Substituting for a, we get 3b² = 9c², that is, b² = 3c².
This means that b² is divisible by 3, and so b is also divisible by 3 (using Theorem 1.2 with p = 3).

Therefore, a and b have at least 3 as a common factor.
But this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime.

This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that √3 is rational.
So, we conclude that √3 is irrational.

In Class IX, we mentioned that :
*   the sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational and
*   the product and quotient of a non-zero rational and irrational number is irrational.

We prove some particular cases here.

### Example 6: Show that 5 - √3 is irrational.

**Solution:** Let us assume, to the contrary, that 5 – √3 is rational.

That is, we can find coprime a and b (b ≠ 0) such that 5 – √3 = a/b.

Therefore, 5 - a/b = √3.

Rearranging this equation, we get √3 = 5 - a/b = (5b - a)/b.

Since a and b are integers, we get 5 - a/b is rational, and so √3 is rational.

But this contradicts the fact that √3 is irrational.

This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 5 - √3 is rational.

So, we conclude that 5 - √3 is irrational.

### Example 7: Show that 3√2 is irrational.

**Solution:** Let us assume, to the contrary, that 3√2 is rational.

That is, we can find coprime a and b (b ≠ 0) such that 3√2 = a/b.

Rearranging, we get √2 = a/(3b).

Since 3, a and b are integers, a/(3b) is rational, and so √2 is rational.

## 1.4 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
1. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic :
    Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.
2. If p is a prime and p divides a², then p divides a, where a is a positive integer.
3. To prove that √2, √3 are irrationals.

## A NOTE TO THE READER
You have seen that :
HCF (p, q, r) × LCM (p, q, r) ≠ p × q × r, where p, q, r are positive integers (see Example 8). However, the following results hold good for three numbers p, q and r :

LCM (p, q, r) = (p · q · r · HCF(p, q, r)) / (HCF(p, q) · HCF(q, r) · HCF(p, r))

HCF (p, q, r) = (p · q · r · LCM(p, q, r)) / (LCM(p, q) · LCM(q, r) · LCM(p, r))

## 2.1 Introduction

In Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall that if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called **the degree of the polynomial p(x)**. For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 1, 2y² - 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x³ - 4x² + x - √2 is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u³ - (3/2)u⁴ + 4u² + u - 8 is a polynomial in the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like `1/(x-1)`, `√x + 2`, `1/(x² + 2x + 3)` etc., are not polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 1 is called a **linear polynomial**. For example, 2x – 3, √3x + 5, y + √2, x - 2/11, 3z + 4, (2/3)u + 1, etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as 2x + 5 - x², x³ + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 2 is called a **quadratic polynomial**. The name 'quadratic' has been derived from the word 'quadrate', which means ‘square'. 2x² + 3x – 2/5, y² - 2, 2 - x² + √3x, u/3 - 2u² + 5, √5v² - (2/3)v, 4z² + 1/7 are some examples of quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers and a ≠ 0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a **cubic polynomial**. Some examples of

## POLYNOMIALS
a cubic polynomial are 2 – x³, x³, √2x², 3 − x² + x³, 3x³ - 2x² + x − 1. In fact, the most general form of a cubic polynomial is
ax³ + bx² + cx + d,
where, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a ≠ 0.

Now consider the polynomial p(x) = x² - 3x – 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the polynomial, we get p(2) = 2² – 3 × 2 – 4 = - 6. The value ‘- 6', obtained by replacing x by 2 in x² - 3x-4, is the value of x² - 3x-4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of p(x) at x = 0, which is - 4.

If p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if *k* is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing x by *k* in p(x), is called **the value of p(x) at x = k**, and is denoted by p(*k*).

What is the value of p(x) = x² - 3x – 4 at x = -1? We have :
p(-1) = (-1)² - {3 × (-1)} - 4 = 0

Also, note that p(4) = 4² - (3 × 4) - 4 = 0.

As p(-1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, -1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x² - 3x - 4. More generally, a real number *k* is said to be a **zero of a polynomial p(x)**, if p(*k*) = 0.

You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if *k* is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(*k*) = 0 gives us
2*k* + 3 = 0, i.e., *k* = -3/2.

In general, if *k* is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(*k*) = a*k* + b = 0, i.e., *k* = -b/a.

So, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is -b/a = - (Constant term) / Coefficient of x.

Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial also related to its coefficients?

In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the division algorithm for polynomials.

## 2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial
You know that a real number *k* is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(*k*) = 0. But why are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the **geometrical representations** of linear and quadratic polynomials and the **geometrical meaning** of their zeroes.

Consider first a linear polynomial ax + b, a ≠ 0. You have studied in Class IX that the graph of y = ax + b is a straight line. For example, the graph of y = 2x + 3 is a straight line passing through the points (– 2, – 1) and (2, 7).

| x         | -2 | 2 |
|-----------|----|---|
| y = 2x + 3| -1 | 7 |

From Fig. 2.1, you can see that the graph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the x-axis mid-way between x = -1 and x = -2, that is, at the point (-3/2, 0).

You also know that the zero of 2x + 3 is -3/2. Thus, the zero of the polynomial 2x + 3 is the x-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the x-axis.

Fig. 2.1

In general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a ≠ 0, the graph of y = ax + b is a straight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely, (-b/a, 0).

Therefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a ≠ 0, has exactly one zero, namely, the x-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis.

Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial x^2 - 3x - 4. Let us see what the graph* of y = x^2 - 3x - 4 looks like. Let us list a few values of y = x^2 - 3x – 4 corresponding to a few values for x as given in Table 2.1.

| `y = x² - 3x - 4` | 6  | 0  | -4 | -6 | -6 | -4 | 0  | 6  |

If we locate the points listed above on a graph paper and draw the graph, it will actually look like the one given in Fig. 2.2.

In fact, for any quadratic polynomial `ax² + bx + c, a ≠ 0`, the graph of the corresponding equation `y = ax² + bx + c` has one of the two shapes either open upwards like `U` or open downwards like `∩` depending on whether `a > 0` or `a < 0`. (These curves are called **parabolas**.)

You can see from Table 2.1 that -1 and 4 are zeroes of the quadratic polynomial. Also note from Fig. 2.2 that -1 and 4 are the x-coordinates of the points where the graph of `y = x² - 3x - 4` intersects the x-axis. Thus, the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial `x² - 3x - 4` are x-coordinates of the points where the graph of `y = x² - 3x - 4` intersects the x-axis.

### Fig. 2.2

This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial `ax² + bx + c, a ≠ 0`, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the parabola representing `y = ax² + bx + c` intersects the x-axis.

From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of `y = ax² + bx + c`, the following three cases can happen:

### Case (i)
Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A'.
The x-coordinates of A and A' are the **two zeroes** of the quadratic polynomial ax² + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3).

Fig. 2.3

### Case (ii)
Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident points. So, the two points A and A' of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A (see Fig. 2.4).

Fig. 2.4

The x-coordinate of A is the **only zero** for the quadratic polynomial ax² + bx + c in this case.

### Case (iii)
Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below the x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).

(i)
(ii)

Fig. 2.5

So, the quadratic polynomial ax^2 + bx + c has **no zero** in this case.
So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a polynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.
Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x^3 – 4x. To see what the graph of y = x^3 - 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few values for x as shown in Table 2.2.

Table 2.2
| X           | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1  | 2 |
| :---------- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| y = x^3 - 4x | 0  | 3  | 0 | -3 | 0 |

Locating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see that the graph of y = x^3 - 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.

We see from the table above that - 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the cubic polynomial x^2 - 4x. Observe that - 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the x-coordinates of the only points where the graph of y = x^2 - 4x intersects the x- axis. Since the curve meets the x-axis in only these 3 points, their x-coordinates are the only zeroes of the polynomial.

Let us take a few more examples. Consider the cubic polynomials x^3 and x^3 - x^2. We draw the graphs of y = x^3 and y = x^3 - x^2 in Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.

Note that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x³. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see that 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x³ intersects the x-axis. Similarly, since x² - x² = x² (x−1), 0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial x³ - x². Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points where the graph of y = x³ - x² intersects the x-axis.

From the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.
**Remark** : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x) intersects the x-axis at utmost n points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has at most n zeroes.

## 2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial

You have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial ax + b is -b/a. We will now try to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial, say p(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term '- 8x' as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x^2 = 12x^2. So, we write
2x^2 - 8x + 6 = 2x^2 - 6x - 2x + 6 = 2x(x - 3) - 2(x - 3)
= (2x - 2)(x - 3) = 2(x - 1)(x - 3)

Reprint 2025-26
n ---------------------------- 

# Page Number: 19
## POLYNOMIALS

So, the value of p(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 6 is zero when x - 1 = 0 or x - 3 = 0, i.e., when x = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2x^2 - 8x + 6 are 1 and 3. Observe that :

Sum of its zeroes = 1 + 3 = 4 = -(-8)/2 = -(Coefficient of x)/Coefficient of x^2

Product of its zeroes = 1 × 3 = 3 = 6/2 = Constant term/Coefficient of x^2

Let us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2. By the method of splitting the middle term,

3x^2 + 5x − 2 = 3x^2 + 6x − x − 2 = 3x(x + 2) - 1(x + 2)
= (3x - 1)(x + 2)

Hence, the value of 3x^2 + 5x - 2 is zero when either 3x - 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,

when x = 1/3 or x = -2. So, the zeroes of 3x^2 + 5x - 2 are 1/3 and -2. Observe that :

Sum of its zeroes = 1/3 + (-2) = -5/3 = -(Coefficient of x)/Coefficient of x^2

Product of its zeroes = 1/3 × (-2) = -2/3 = Constant term/Coefficient of x^2

In general, if α and β are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, a ≠ 0, then you know that x - α and x - β are the factors of p(x). Therefore,

ax^2 + bx + c = k(x − α) (x − β), where k is a constant
= k[x^2 - (α + β)x + α β]
= kx^2 - k(α + β)x + kα β

Comparing the coefficients of x^2, x and constant terms on both the sides, we get
a = k, b = - k(α + β) and c = kαβ.

This gives

α + β = -b/a

αβ = c/a

i.e.,
sum of zeroes = $\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a} = -\frac{\text{(Coefficient of x)}}{\text{Coefficient of x}^2}$

product of zeroes = $\alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of x}^2}$

Let us consider some examples.

### Example 2:
Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial x² + 7x + 10, and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.

**Solution**: We have
x² + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)

So, the value of x² + 7x + 10 is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x + 5 = 0, i.e., when x = -2 or x = -5. Therefore, the zeroes of x² + 7x + 10 are -2 and -5. Now,

sum of zeroes = $-2 + (-5) = -(7) = -\frac{(7)}{1} = -\frac{\text{(Coefficient of x)}}{\text{Coefficient of x}^2}$

product of zeroes = $(-2)\times(-5) = 10 = \frac{10}{1} = \frac{\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of x}^2}$

### Example 3:
Find the zeroes of the polynomial x² - 3 and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.

**Solution**: Recall the identity a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Using it, we can write:
x² - 3 = $(x - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{3})$

So, the value of x² - 3 is zero when x = $\sqrt{3}$ or x = $-\sqrt{3}$.

Therefore, the zeroes of x² - 3 are $\sqrt{3}$ and $-\sqrt{3}$.

Now,
sum of zeroes = $\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3} = 0 = -\frac{\text{(Coefficient of x)}}{\text{Coefficient of x}^2}$

product of zeroes = $(\sqrt{3})(-\sqrt{3}) = -3 = -\frac{3}{1} = \frac{\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of x}^2}$

### Example 4:
Find a quadratic polynomial, the sum and product of whose zeroes are - 3 and 2, respectively.

### Solution:
Let the quadratic polynomial be ax² + bx + c, and its zeroes be α and β.
We have
α + β = – 3 = $-\frac{b}{a}$

and
αβ = 2 = $\frac{c}{a}$

If a = 1, then b = 3 and c = 2.
So, one quadratic polynomial which fits the given conditions is x² + 3x + 2.
You can check that any other quadratic polynomial that fits these conditions will be of the form k(x² + 3x + 2), where k is real.

Let us now look at cubic polynomials. Do you think a similar relation holds between the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients?
Let us consider p(x) = 2x³ - 5x² - 14x + 8.
You can check that p(x) = 0 for x = 4, -2, $\frac{1}{2}$. Since p(x) can have at most three zeroes, these are the zeroes of 2x³ - 5x² - 14x + 8. Now,

sum of the zeroes = 4 + (-2) + $\frac{1}{2}$ = $\frac{5}{2}$ = $\frac{-(-5)}{2}$ = $\frac{\text{-(Coefficient of x²)}}{\text{Coefficient of x³}}$

product of the zeroes = 4 × (-2) × $\frac{1}{2}$ = -4 = $\frac{-8}{2}$ = $\frac{\text{-Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of x³}}$

However, there is one more relationship here. Consider the sum of the products of the zeroes taken two at a time. We have

{4 × (-2)} + {(-2) × $\frac{1}{2}$} + {$\frac{1}{2}$ × 4}
= -8 - 1 + 2 = -7 = $\frac{-14}{2}$ = $\frac{\text{Coefficient of x}}{\text{Coefficient of x³}}$

In general, it can be proved that if α, β, γ are the zeroes of the cubic polynomial ax³ + bx² + cx + d, then

$$\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \frac{-b}{a}$$
$$\alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha = \frac{c}{a}$$
$$\alpha\beta\gamma = \frac{-d}{a}$$

Let us consider an example.

## **Example 5\***: Verify that 3, -1, $\frac{-1}{3}$ are the zeroes of the cubic polynomial p(x) = 3x³ - 5x² - 11x - 3, and then verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.

## **Solution**: Comparing the given polynomial with ax³ + bx² + cx + d, we get
a = 3, b = -5, c = -11, d = -3. Further
p(3) = 3 × 3³ - (5 × 3²) - (11 × 3) - 3 = 81 - 45 - 33 - 3 = 0,
p(-1) = 3 × (-1)³ - 5 × (-1)² - 11 × (-1) - 3 = -3 - 5 + 11 - 3 = 0,
p($\frac{-1}{3}$) = 3 × ($\frac{-1}{3}$)³ - 5 × ($\frac{-1}{3}$)² - 11 × ($\frac{-1}{3}$) - 3
= $\frac{-1}{9}$ - $\frac{5}{9}$ + $\frac{11}{3}$ - 3 = $\frac{-2}{3}$ + $\frac{2}{3}$ = 0

Therefore, 3, -1 and $\frac{-1}{3}$ are the zeroes of 3x³ - 5x² - 11x - 3.
So, we take α = 3, β = -1 and γ = $\frac{-1}{3}$.
Now,

$$\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 3 + (-1) + (\frac{-1}{3}) = 2 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{3} = \frac{-(-5)}{3} = \frac{-b}{a},$$
$$\alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha = 3 \times (-1) + (-1) \times (\frac{-1}{3}) + (\frac{-1}{3}) \times 3 = -3 + \frac{1}{3} - 1 = \frac{-11}{3} = \frac{c}{a}$$
$$\alpha\beta\gamma = 3 \times (-1) \times (\frac{-1}{3}) = 1 = \frac{-(-3)}{3} = \frac{-d}{a}.$$

## 3.1 Introduction

You must have come across situations like the one given below :

Akhila went to a fair in her village. She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs ₹ 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ₹ 4, how would you find out the number of rides she had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ₹ 20.

May be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge of Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.

Let us try this approach.

Denote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she played Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:

y = 1/2 x (1)
3x + 4y = 20 (2)

Can we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of finding these, which we will study in this chapter.

## 3.2 Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations

A pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a consistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is always consistent.

We can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:

*   (i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations has a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).
*   (ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution (inconsistent pair of equations).
*   (iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].

Consider the following three pairs of equations.

*   (i) x - 2y = 0 and 3x + 4y - 20 = 0 (The lines intersect)
*   (ii) 2x + 3y - 9 = 0 and 4x + 6y - 18 = 0 (The lines coincide)
*   (iii) x + 2y - 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y - 12 = 0 (The lines are parallel)

Let us now write down, and compare, the values of a₁/a₂, b₁/b₂ and c₁/c₂ in all the three examples. Here, a₁, b₁, c₁ and a₂, b₂, c₂ denote the coefficients of equations given in the general form in Section 3.2.

From the table above, you can observe that if the lines represented by the equation

$a_1x + b_1y + c_1 = 0$
and
$a_2x + b_2y + c_2 = 0$

are
(i) intersecting, then $a_1/a_2 \neq b_1/b_2$.
(ii) coincident, then $a_1/a_2 = b_1/b_2 = c_1/c_2$.
(iii) parallel, then $a_1/a_2 = b_1/b_2 \neq c_1/c_2$.

In fact, the converse is also true for any pair of lines. You can verify them by considering some more examples by yourself.
Let us now consider some more examples to illustrate it.

### Example 1 : Check graphically whether the pair of equations

x + 3y = 6 (1)
and
2x - 3y = 12 (2)

is consistent. If so, solve them graphically.

We observe that there is a point
B(6, 0) common to both the lines
AB and PQ. So, the solution of the
pair of linear equations is $x = 6$ and
$y = 0$, i.e., the given pair of equations
is consistent.

### **Example 2**: Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution,
unique solution or infinitely many solutions:

$5x - 8y + 1 = 0$ (1)
$3x - \frac{24}{5}y + \frac{3}{5} = 0$ (2)

**Solution**: Multiplying Equation (2) by $\frac{5}{3}$, we get

$5x - 8y + 1 = 0$

But, this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1)
and (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.

Plot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.

Plot the points and draw the lines passing through them to represent the equations, as shown in Fig. 3.2.

The two lines intersect at the point (1, 0). So, *x* = 1, *y* = 0 is the required solution of the pair of linear equations, i.e., the number of pants she purchased is 1 and she did not buy any skirt.

**Verify** the answer by checking whether it satisfies the conditions of the given problem.

## 3.3 Algebraic Methods of Solving a Pair of Linear Equations

In the previous section, we discussed how to solve a pair of linear equations graphically. The graphical method is not convenient in cases when the point representing the solution of the linear equations has non-integral coordinates like ($\sqrt{3}$, 2$\sqrt{7}$), (-1.75, 3.3), $\left(\frac{4}{13}, \frac{1}{19}\right)$, etc. There is every possibility of making mistakes while reading such coordinates. Is there any alternative method of finding the solution? There are several algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss.

### 3.3.1 Substitution Method: We shall explain the method of substitution by taking some examples.

**Example 4:** Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method:
7x - 15y = 2 (1)
x + 2y = 3 (2)

**Solution :**
**Step 1:** We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other.
Let us consider the Equation (2) :
x + 2y = 3
and write it as
x = 3 - 2y (3)

**Step 2:** Substitute the value of x in Equation (1). We get
7(3 - 2y) - 15y = 2
i.e., 21 - 14y - 15y = 2
i.e., -29y = -19
Therefore,
y = $\frac{19}{29}$

**Step 3:** Substituting this value of y in Equation (3), we get
x = 3 - 2$\left(\frac{19}{29}\right)$ = $\frac{49}{29}$

Therefore, the solution is x = $\frac{49}{29}$, y = $\frac{19}{29}$.

n ---------------------------- 

# Page Number: 31
## PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES

**Verification** : Substituting $x = \frac{49}{29}$ and $y = \frac{19}{29}$, you can verify that both the Equations (1) and (2) are satisfied.

To understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise:

**Step 1**: Find the value of one variable, say $y$ in terms of the other variable, i.e., $x$ from either equation, whichever is convenient.
**Step 2**: Substitute this value of $y$ in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in one variable, i.e., in terms of $x$, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and 10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can conclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement is false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.
**Step 3**: Substitute the value of $x$ (or $y$) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in Step 1 to obtain the value of the other variable.

**Remark**: We have **substituted** the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of the other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is known as the *substitution method*.

**Example 5**: Solve the following question—Aftab tells his daughter, “Seven years ago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be three times as old as you will be.” (Isn't this interesting?) Represent this situation algebraically and graphically by the method of substitution.

**Solution**: Let $s$ and $t$ be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively. Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is
$s - 7 = 7 (t - 7)$, i.e., $s – 7t + 42 = 0$ (1)
and $s + 3 = 3 (t + 3)$, i.e., $s – 3t = 6$ (2)

Using Equation (2), we get $s = 3t + 6$.

Putting this value of $s$ in Equation (1), we get
$(3t+6) - 7t + 42 = 0$,
i.e., $4t = 48$, which gives $t = 12$.

Putting this value of $t$ in Equation (2), we get
$s = 3 (12) + 6 = 42$

So, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively.
Verify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems.

### Example 6
In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is ₹9 and the cost of 4 pencils and 6 erasers is ₹18. Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser.

**Solution:** The pair of linear equations formed were:
2x + 3y = 9 (1)
4x + 6y = 18 (2)

We first express the value of x in terms of y from the equation 2x + 3y = 9, to get
x = (9-3y)/2 (3)

Now we substitute this value of x in Equation (2), to get
4(9-3y)/2 + 6y = 18
i.e.,
18 - 6y + 6y = 18
i.e.,
18 = 18

This statement is true for all values of y. However, we do not get a specific value of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This situation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have *infinitely many solutions*. We cannot find a unique cost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the given situation.

### Example 7
Two rails are represented by the equations x + 2y - 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0. Will the rails cross each other?

**Solution:** The pair of linear equations formed were:
x + 2y - 4 = 0 (1)
2x + 4y - 12 = 0 (2)

We express x in terms of y from Equation (1) to get
x = 4 - 2y

Now, we substitute this value of x in Equation (2) to get
2(4-2y) + 4y – 12 = 0

# Page Number: 33
# PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES

i.e., `8 - 12 = 0`
i.e., `- 4 = 0`
which is a false statement.
Therefore, the equations do not have a common solution. So, the two rails will not cross each other.

## 3.3.2 Elimination Method

Now let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method works.

**Example 8** : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ₹2000 per month, find their monthly incomes.

**Solution** : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ₹ 9x and ₹ 7x and their expenditures by ₹ 4y and ₹ 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation is given by:

9x - 4y = 2000 (1)
and
7x - 3y = 2000 (2)

**Step 1** : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of y equal. Then we get the equations:

27x - 12y = 6000 (3)
28x - 12y = 8000 (4)

**Step 2** : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients of y are the same. So, we get

(28x - 27x) - (12y - 12y) = 8000 - 6000
i.e.,
x = 2000

**Step 3** : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get

9(2000) - 4y = 2000
i.e.,
y = 4000

So, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes of the persons are ₹ 18,000 and ₹ 14,000, respectively.

**Verification** : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures = 18000 - 2000 : 14000 - 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3

**Remarks** :
1. The method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method, because we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable.

## PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES

In the example above, we eliminated y. We could also have eliminated x. Try doing it that way.
2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this problem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient.
Let us now note down these steps in the elimination method :

**Step 1:** First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make the coefficients of one variable (either x or y) numerically equal.
**Step 2:** Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets eliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3.
   If in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has infinitely many solutions.
   If in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.
**Step 3:** Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) so obtained to get its value.
**Step 4:** Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the value of the other variable.

Now to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples.

**Example 9:** Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair of linear equations :
```
2x + 3y = 8   (1)
4x + 6y = 7   (2)
```

### Solution:

**Step 1:** Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of x equal. Then we get the equations as :
```
4x + 6y = 16   (3)
4x + 6y = 7    (4)
```

**Step 2:** Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3),
```
(4x - 4x) + (6y - 6y) = 16 - 7
```
i.e.,
```
0 = 9, which is a false statement.
```
Therefore, the pair of equations has no solution.

**Example 10:** The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing the digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such numbers are there?

Reprint 2025-26

# Page Number: 36
## MATHEMATICS

**Solution**: Let the ten's and the unit's digits in the first number be x and y, respectively.
So, the first number may be written as 10x + y in the expanded form (for example,
56 = 10(5) + 6).

When the digits are reversed, x becomes the unit's digit and y becomes the ten's
digit. This number, in the expanded notation is 10y + x (for example, when 56 is
reversed, we get 65 = 10(6) + 5).
According to the given condition.
(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 66
i.e.,
11(x + y) = 66
i.e.,
x + y = 6 (1)
We are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore,
either
x - y = 2 (2)
or
y - x = 2 (3)
If x - y = 2, then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get x = 4 and y = 2.
In this case, we get the number 42.
If y - x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we get x = 2 and y = 4.
In this case, we get the number 24.
Thus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24.
**Verification**: Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 - 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4 - 2 = 2.

# QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

## 4.1 Introduction

In Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the quadratic polynomial of the form ax² + bx + c, a ≠ 0. When we equate this polynomial to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with many real-life situations. For instance, suppose a charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length one metre more than twice its breadth. What should be the length and breadth of the hall? Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then, its length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict this information pictorially as shown in *Fig. 4.1*.

x
300 m²
2x + 1
*Fig. 4.1*

Now, area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m² = (2x² + x) m²
So, 2x² + x = 300 (Given)
Therefore, 2x² + x - 300 = 0

So, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x² + x - 300 = 0 which is a quadratic equation.

Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations. For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation of the form x² - px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology, are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598-665) gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx = c. Later,

## QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

Sridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula, (as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing the square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book 'Liber embadorum' published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of different quadratic equations.

In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life situations.

### 4.2 Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax²+bx+c=0, where a, b, c are real numbers, a ≠ 0. For example, 2x² + x − 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation. Similarly, 2x² - 3x + 1 = 0, 4x - 3x² + 2 = 0 and 1 - x² + 300 = 0 are also quadratic equations.

In fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree 2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax² + bx + c = 0, a ≠ 0 is called the **standard form of a quadratic equation**.

Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in different fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.

### Example 1: Represent the following situations mathematically:
(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with.
(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was ₹ 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.

### Solution:
(i) Let the number of marbles John had be x.
Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?).
The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x - 5
The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 - x - 5
= 40 - x

# Page Number: 40
MATHEMATICS

Therefore, their product = (x - 5) (40 - x)
= 40x - x² - 200 + 5x
= - x² + 45x - 200
So, - x² + 45x - 200 = 124 (Given that product = 124)
i.e., - x² + 45x - 324 = 0
i.e., x² - 45x + 324 = 0
Therefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation
x² - 45x + 324 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.

(ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x.
Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 - x
So, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 - x)
[UNREADABLE]
Therefore, x (55 - x) = 750
i.e., 55x - x² = 750
i.e., - x² + 55x - 750 = 0
i.e., x² - 55x + 750 = 0
Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation
x² - 55x + 750 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.

## Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
(i) (x - 2)² + 1 = 2x - 3
(iii) x(2x + 3) = x² + 1
(ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x - 2)
(iv) (x + 2)³ = x² - 4

## Solution :
(i) LHS = (x - 2)² + 1 = x² - 4x + 4 + 1 = x² - 4x + 5
Therefore, (x - 2)² + 1 = 2x – 3 can be rewritten as
x² - 4x + 5 = 2x - 3
i.e., x² - 6x + 8 = 0
It is of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.
Therefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation.

# Page Number: 41
# QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

(ii) Since x(x + 1) + 8 = x^2 + x + 8 and (x + 2)(x - 2) = x^2 - 4
Therefore,
x^2 + x + 8 = x^2 - 4
i.e.,
x + 12 = 0
It is not of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
Therefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation.

(iii) Here, LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x^2 + 3x
So, x(2x + 3) = x^2 + 1 can be rewritten as
2x^2 + 3x = x^2 + 1
Therefore, we get
x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0
It is of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.

(iv) Here, LHS = (x + 2)^3 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8
Therefore, (x + 2)^3 = x^3 - 4 can be rewritten as
x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8 = x^3 - 4
i.e.,
6x^2 + 12x + 12 = 0 or, x^2 + 2x + 2 = 0
It is of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.

**Remark** : Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic equation, but it is not a quadratic equation.
In (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of degree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As you can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it is quadratic or not.

## EXERCISE 4.1

1. Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
    - (i) (x+1)^2=2(x-3)
    - (ii) x^2-2x=(-2) (3 - x)
    - (iii) (x-2)(x+1)=(x-1)(x+3)
    - (iv) (x-3)(2x+1)=x(x+5)

(iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been 8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We need to find the speed of the train.

## 4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation
Consider the quadratic equation 2x² - 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the LHS of this equation, we get (2 × 1²) - (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation. We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x² – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that 1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x² - 3x + 1.

In general, a real number α is called a root of the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, a ≠ 0 if aα² + bα + c = 0. We also say that x = α is a solution of the quadratic equation, or that α satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the **zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax² + bx + c** and the **roots of the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0** are the same.

You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have at most two roots.

You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic equation. Let us see how.

### Example 3: Find the roots of the equation 2x² - 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.
**Solution**: Let us first split the middle term – 5x as -2x - 3x [because (-2x) × (-3x) = 6x² = (2x²) × 3].
So, 2x² - 5x + 3 = 2x² - 2x – 3x + 3 = 2x (x - 1) - 3(x - 1) = (2x - 3)(x - 1)
Now, 2x² – 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x - 3)(x - 1) = 0.
So, the values of x for which 2x² - 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x - 3)(x - 1) = 0, i.e., either 2x - 3 = 0 or x - 1 = 0.
Now, 2x - 3 = 0 gives x = 3/2 and x - 1 = 0 gives x = 1.
So, x = 3/2 and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation.
In other words, 1 and 3/2 are the roots of the equation 2x² – 5x + 3 = 0.
**Verify** that these are the roots of the given equation.

## QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

**Note that we have found the roots of 2x² - 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising 2x² - 5x + 3 into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero.**

**Example 4** : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x² - x - 2 = 0.
**Solution** : We have
6x² - x - 2 = 6x² + 3x - 4x - 2
= 3x(2x + 1) - 2 (2x + 1)
= (3x - 2)(2x + 1)
The roots of 6x² - x - 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3x - 2)(2x + 1) = 0
Therefore, 3x - 2 = 0 or 2x + 1 = 0,
i.e., x = 2/3 or x = -1/2.
Therefore, the roots of 6x² - x - 2 = 0 are 2/3 and -1/2.
We verify the roots, by checking that 2/3 and -1/2 satisfy 6x² - x - 2 = 0.

**Example 5** : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 3x² - 2√6x + 2 = 0.
**Solution** : 3x² - 2√6x + 2 = 3x² - √6x - √6x + 2
= √3x(√3x - √2) - √2(√3x - √2)
= (√3x - √2)(√3x - √2)
So, the roots of the equation are the values of x for which
(√3x - √2)(√3x - √2) = 0
Now, √3x - √2 = 0 for x = √(2/3).
So, this root is repeated twice, one for each repeated factor √3x - √2.
Therefore, the roots of 3x² - 2√6x + 2 = 0 are √(2/3), √(2/3).

**Example 6**: Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1.
**Solution**: In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x satisfies the equation 2x² + x − 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write this equation as
2x² - 24x + 25x - 300 = 0
2x (x - 12) + 25 (x - 12) = 0
i.e.,
(x - 12)(2x + 25) = 0
So, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x = - 12.5. Since x is the breadth of the hall, it cannot be negative.
Thus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2x + 1 = 25 m.

## 4.4 Nature of Roots

The equation ax² + bx + c = 0 are given by
x = `(-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)`

If b² - 4ac > 0, we get two distinct real roots `-b / (2a)` - `√(b² - 4ac) / (2a)` and `-b / (2a)` + `√(b² - 4ac) / (2a)`

Reprint 2025-26
n ---------------------------- 

# Page Number: 45
## QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

If b² - 4ac = 0, then x = -b/2a ± 0, i.e., x = -b/2a or -b/2a.

So, the roots of the equation ax² + bx + c = 0 are both -b/2a.

Therefore, we say that the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 has two equal real roots in this case.

If b² - 4ac < 0, then there is no real number whose square is b² - 4ac. Therefore, there are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case.

Since b² - 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 has real roots or not, b² - 4ac is called the **discriminant** of this quadratic equation.

So, a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 has
*   (i) two distinct real roots, if b² - 4ac > 0,
*   (ii) two equal real roots, if b² - 4ac = 0,
*   (iii) no real roots, if b² - 4ac < 0.

Let us consider some examples.

**Example 7:** Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x² - 4x + 3 = 0, and hence find the nature of its roots.

**Solution:** The given equation is of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = -4 and c = 3. Therefore, the discriminant
b² - 4ac = (-4)² - (4 × 2 × 3) = 16 - 24 = -8 < 0

So, the given equation has no real roots.

**Example 8:** A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected?

**Solution:** Let us first draw the diagram (see Fig. 4.2).

Let P be the required location of the pole. Let the distance of the pole from the gate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the difference of the distances of the pole from the two gates = AP - BP (or, BP - AP) = 7 m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m.

## MATHEMATICS

Now, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter,
∠APB = 90° (Why?)
Therefore, AP² + PB² = AB² (By Pythagoras theorem)
i.e., (x + 7)² + x² = 13²
i.e., x² + 14x + 49 + x² = 169
i.e., 2x² + 14x - 120 = 0
So, the distance 'x' of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation
x² + 7x - 60 = 0

So, it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this is so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is
b² - 4ac = 7² - 4 × 1 × (-60) = 289 > 0.
So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the pole on the boundary of the park.
Solving the quadratic equation x² + 7x - 60 = 0, by the quadratic formula, we get
x = (-7 ± √289) / 2 = (-7 ± 17) / 2

Therefore, x = 5 or -12.
Since x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive.
Therefore, x = -12 will have to be ignored. So, x = 5.
Thus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m from the gate B and 12m from the gate A.

## Example 9

Find the discriminant of the equation 3x² - 2x + 1/3 = 0 and hence find the nature of its roots. Find them, if they are real.

### Solution

Here a = 3, b = -2 and c = 1/3.
Therefore, discriminant b² - 4ac = (-2)² - 4 × 3 × 1/3 = 4 - 4 = 0.
Hence, the given quadratic equation has two equal real roots.
The roots are -b/(2a), -b/(2a), i.e., 2/6, 2/6, i.e., 1/3, 1/3

### 4.5 Summary

In this chapter, you have studied the following points:

1.  A quadratic equation in the variable x is of the form `ax^2+bx+c=0`, where a, b, c are real numbers and `a != 0`.
2.  A real number `alpha` is said to be a root of the quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, if `a(alpha)^2+b(alpha)+c=0`. The zeroes of the quadratic polynomial `ax^2 + bx + c` and the roots of the quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` are the same.
3.  If we can factorise `ax^2 + bx + c`, `a != 0`, into a product of two linear factors, then the roots of the quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` can be found by equating each factor to zero.
4.  Quadratic formula: The roots of a quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` are given by
    `-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a`, provided `b^2 - 4ac >= 0`.
5.  A quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` has
    (i) two distinct real roots, if `b^2 - 4ac > 0`,
    (ii) two equal roots (i.e., coincident roots), if `b^2 - 4ac = 0`, and
    (iii) no real roots, if `b^2 - 4ac < 0`.
